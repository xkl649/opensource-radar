## What this is

**Every serious repo deserves its own agent.** A repo-aware CLI, a repo-aware coding agent, a local MCP server, memory scoped to the project, skills generated from the actual file layout, governance policy, release verification, witness-signed provenance.

`metaharness` mints those, on demand, from a GitHub URL or a blank slate. **It is not another agent framework. It is a factory for agent frameworks.**

The model is replaceable. The harness is the product.

## What it gives you

In under 60 seconds, in your browser, with nothing leaving your machine:

- A custom AI agent harness for your repo (or any repo)
- Recommended agents, skills, slash commands, MCP tools
- A scoped memory namespace + governance policy
- Witness-signed provenance + release gates
- Drops into Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, pi.dev, Hermes, OpenClaw, RVM, or Prime Agent — pick one or all

Output is an npm-publishable `.zip` with **your name on it, your branding, your `npx <your-name>` CLI**.

### New

- **Governed autonomous variation for difficult engineering work.**
  [`@metaharness/avo`](packages/avo/) lets an agent repeatedly inspect, edit,
  execute real tools, evaluate, repair/revert, branch, consult structured RVF
  memory, and commit—while MetaHarness retains immutable capabilities, budgets,
  promotion, quarantine, rollback, and signed replay receipts. Simple work stays
  on Darwin's fast path. The runtime has a deterministic 205-action RVF
  interruption proof; the stronger “AVO-class” claim remains blocked on the
  preregistered 100-task unseen SWE-bench gate in [ADR-251](docs/adrs/ADR-251-governed-autonomous-variation-runtime.md).
- **Run your harness on Prime Agent — and borrow its best ideas.** The 10th host
  ([`@metaharness/host-prime-agent`](packages/host-prime-agent/), `--host prime-agent`) emits your
  tools as project-scoped, Python-backed Prime Agent skills (`.prime/agent/skills/` — the host has
  no MCP) plus an install runbook. **Fail-closed**: Prime Agent can't enforce a deny-list itself,
  so a non-empty deny-list ships a prominent `SANDBOX-REQUIRED.md` instead of silently dropping
  your posture. From its design we also shipped **RefineMutator** — an evidence-backed proposer in
  [`@metaharness/darwin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metaharness/darwin) that must cite the
  failing traces behind each edit or propose nothing — and an opt-in `--sessions` crash-recoverable
  JSONL session log whose Rust and TS (wasm) replays produce identical state hashes. Its PTC
  ("kernel as the only tool") claim is honestly *deferred* behind a pre-registered A/B in
  `evals-toolcall`. See [ADR-246](docs/adrs/ADR-246-prime-agent-continual-harness-refine.md) /
  [ADR-247](docs/adrs/ADR-247-host-prime-agent.md). ($0)
- **Score any repo before you build it.** `npx metaharness score <repo>` reads
  the repo (never runs it) and prints a one-screen report card — how well a
  harness fits, how likely it is to build, how safe the tools are, and the
  rough **cost per run** — so you know what you'll get before scaffolding.
- **Pick the cheapest model that's good enough.** [`@metaharness/router`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metaharness/router)
  routes each request to the right model from your own results — same quality,
  far less spend. Works out of the box with zero native deps; **train it on your
  data** for a sharper fit (`npm i @metaharness/router`). Add the optional
  [`@ruvector/tiny-dancer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ruvector/tiny-dancer)
  to train a fast native model instead — same training data, no API change.
- **Let your harness improve itself.** Every scaffold now ships with **Darwin Mode**
  ([`@metaharness/darwin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metaharness/darwin)) wired in —
  run `npm run evolve` and the harness mutates its own config, tests each change in a
  sandbox, and keeps only what *measurably* improves. The model stays frozen; the harness
  evolves. Safe by default (no network, no API key; pure refactor/tuning behind a safety
  gate). Validated on real **SWE-bench Lite** bug-fixing. `--no-darwin` to skip.
- **Distil the cheap tier instead of escalating to a frontier model.** **Weight-EFT**
  ([`@metaharness/weight-eft`](packages/weight-eft/), `metaharness weight-eft`) takes the
  *complementary* lever to Darwin's gradient-free evolution: it exports the harness's gold-resolved
  archive into standard SFT/DPO sets and LoRA-tunes the open cheap tier (GLM/Qwen), so the
  cost-cascade escalates to Opus/GPT **less often**. It attacks **cost** (fewer $0.50 escalations),
  not the frontier ceiling — and stays honest about it. Strict train/eval-disjointness +
  reward-hacking filters keep the lift real; the tune is a *gene* Darwin can prune if it overfits.
  See [ADR-198](docs/adrs/ADR-198-weight-eft-hybrid-policy-weight-evolution.md). ($0 / GPU-gated.)

## Tune it to your project — then ship it as your own npm

A generated harness is a **starting point you own**, not a fixed framework. Open
it and make it yours:

- **Keep only what your repo needs.** Delete the agents, skills, slash commands,
  and MCP servers you won't use — the scaffold ships a recommended set, but a
  payments service and a docs site want very different harnesses. A smaller,
  targeted harness is faster, cheaper, and easier to reason about. `harness
  doctor` / `harness validate` keep it healthy as you trim.
- **Optimize the model routing for your work.** Swap the per-task model tiers,
  tighten the governance policy, point the memory namespace at your domain. The
  harness is config you control, not a black box.
- **Publish it as your own package for the whole org.** Rename it, set your
  scope, and `npm publish` — now anyone on your team runs
  `npx @your-org/your-harness` and gets the *same* repo-tuned agent. One
  command, org-wide, versioned like any other dependency. (The 19
  [`@metaharness/*`](examples-packages/) examples are exactly this pattern,
  published live.)

**Make older, cheaper models punch like frontier ones.** The right harness
isn't a pile of extra steps bolted onto an expensive model — it's putting the
*right* model on each task and getting out of the way. Our [DRACO](packages/bench/draco/)
benchmark proves it: a small, cheap model delivers **frontier-quality** research
at roughly **one-tenth the cost**, and a smart router squeezes out the rest.
Stop paying frontier prices for work a $0.10 model does just as well.

That router ships as [`@metaharness/router`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metaharness/router)
— `route(query)` returns the cheapest model predicted to clear your quality bar,
learned from your own eval logs. `npm i @metaharness/router`.

## Try it in 30 seconds

```bash
# In the browser — zero install, nothing leaves the page
open https://ruvnet.github.io/metaharness/

# Or in the terminal — the same harness (behaviourally equivalent output)
npx metaharness my-bot --template vertical:coding --host claude-code
cd my-bot && npx . --help
```

**Don't know what to pick?** Run the wizard:

```bash
npx metaharness --wizard
```

**Already have a repo you want a harness for?**

```bash
harness analyze-repo .                       # local — deterministic analysis only
harness analyze-repo . --scaffold my-bot     # materialise the recommended harness
```

No repository code is executed. Inferred build/test commands are emitted as `trust: inferred · execution: disabled`.

## Hosts

The same harness output runs on **ten** agent hosts — nine interactive, plus GitHub Actions (CI/CD):

| Host | What ships | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [**Claude Code**](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp) | MCP server + hooks + 3-scope settings | Richest surface; Ruflo-native |
| [**OpenAI Codex**](https://developers.openai.com/codex) | MCP via `~/.codex/config.toml` | TOML, no hooks |
| [**pi.dev**](https://pi.dev/) | Pi extension via `pi.registerTool()` | No MCP by design |
| [**Hermes**](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/) | MCP runtime, `<think>` scrubbing | Per Hermes issue #741 |
| [**OpenClaw**](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) | `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` + workspace skills | Personal-AI gateway |
| [**RVM**](https://github.com/ruvnet/rvm) | Bare-metal microhypervisor + capability tokens | Hardware isolation for untrusted peers |
| [**GitHub Copilot**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/mcp) | MCP via `.vscode/mcp.json` | VSCode 1.99+ (ADR-032) |
| [**OpenCode**](https://opencode.ai/) | MCP via `.opencode/opencode.json` | sst/opencode TUI (ADR-036) |
| [**Prime Agent**](packages/host-prime-agent/) | `.prime/agent/` skills (Python-backed, no MCP) + `install-prime-agent.md` | Fail-closed sandbox posture (ADR-247) |
| [**GitHub Actions**](https://docs.github.com/actions) | `.github/workflows/` + composite `action.yml` | **Non-interactive** CI/CD; default-deny via `permissions:` (ADR-033) |

See [ADR-004 — Host integration model](docs/adrs/ADR-004-host-integration-model.md) and [ADR-033 — GitHub Actions host](docs/adrs/ADR-033-host-github-actions.md).

---

## MCP — modular, default-deny

MCP is included as a first-class **adapter surface, not the identity**. It is gated and default-deny ([ADR-022](docs/adrs/ADR-022-mcp-primitive.md)):

- Modes: `off` · `local` (stdio) · `remote` (HTTPS + auth)
- Emits `src/mcp/{server,tools,resources,prompts,policy,audit}.ts` + a scannable `.harness/mcp-policy.json`
- Safe defaults: no network, no shell, no file-write, approve-dangerous, 30s timeout, 8 calls/turn, audit on
- `harness mcp-scan <path>` — *"npm audit for agent tools"*: static-only scan flagging shell/network grants, missing audit/timeouts, wildcard permissions, unguarded secrets, unpinned deps. Exits 1 on any HIGH.

---

## Verticals (19 quick-start templates)

```bash
npx metaharness --list
npx metaharness my-bot --template vertical:coding
```

| Category | Templates |
|---|---|
| Starter / Operations | `minimal`, `vertical:devops` |
| Engineering | `vertical:coding`, `vertical:ai`, **`vertical:repo-maintainer`** (iter 113) |
| Knowledge | `vertical:research`, `vertical:ruview`, `vertical:education` |
| Finance / Pro | `vertical:trading`, `vertical:legal`, `vertical:health` |
| Customer / Growth | `vertical:support`, `vertical:crm`, `vertical:marketing`, `vertical:advertising`, `vertical:sales` |
| Business / Frontier | `vertical:business`, `vertical:agentics`, `vertical:gaming`, `vertical:exotic` |

Each ships bespoke domain agents (with system prompts), skills, commands, and per-host settings — all default-deny.

---

## One-command examples

Don't want to pick flags? Each host and vertical has a dedicated
`@metaharness/*` wrapper — **published, one `npx` away**, no template/host
flags to remember. A scaffold from a wrapper is byte-identical to the
equivalent `metaharness` invocation.

## Quality gates

| Concern | Where |
|---|---|
| **CI** | [`ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) — Rust 3-platform × fmt/clippy/test/doc + WASM build + size budget + Node 20/22 × 3-platform |
| **Publish** | [`publish.yml`](.github/workflows/publish.yml) — GCP WIF → Secret Manager → smoke → `npm publish --provenance` (SLSA L2) |
| **Security** | [`security.yml`](.github/workflows/security.yml) — cargo-audit + cargo-deny + npm-audit + CodeQL + weekly cron |
| **Provenance** | [ADR-011](docs/adrs/ADR-011-witness-and-provenance.md) — Ed25519-signed witness manifest, byte-deterministic across runners |
| **Studio liveness** | [`pages-monitor.yml`](.github/workflows/pages-monitor.yml) — daily HTTP probe of live Studio |
| **Research quality (DRACO)** | [`draco.yml`](.github/workflows/draco.yml) — cross-domain deep-research benchmark ([ADR-037](docs/adrs/ADR-037-draco-deep-research-benchmark.md)). Deterministic subset gates the scorer/runner machinery on every push (offline); a weekly judged cadence runs the real OpenRouter-fusion score. 5 dimensions (grounding/coverage/balance/cleanliness/faithfulness); the verifier + judge are different model families than the synthesizer (fusion). See [`packages/bench/draco/`](packages/bench/draco/). |

## Cost-Pareto Leaderboard

**[→ Live leaderboard — the cost-performance Pareto frontier](https://ruvnet.github.io/metaharness/cost-pareto.html)**

Which harness resolves the most benchmark per **dollar**, not just the highest raw score — ranked by a tunable
**Value Score** that blends capability and price. Tabs: SWE-bench **Lite** / **Verified** / **Pro** / **DRACO** /
**SWE-ultralite** (a fast n=25 model×mode scouting map). Every Darwin row is fully conformant (the solver never
sees gold tests during solving) and measured with the official `swebench` Docker harness, with Wilson 95% CIs.

**Latest validated, conformant results (2026-06-26):**

| benchmark | config | resolve | n | Wilson 95% CI | cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SWE-bench Verified** | GLM→Opus empty-patch cascade | **55.6%** (278/500) | 500 | **[51.2, 59.9]** | ~$0.15/inst (est.) |
| SWE-bench Lite | GLM→Opus empty-patch cascade | 51.3% | 300 | — | ~$0.27/inst |
| **LiveCodeBench** (release_v5 ≥2024-12-01) | single-shot | **44%** | 100 | — | — |
| **LiveCodeBench** (release_v5 ≥2024-12-01) | cost-cascade | **62%** | 100 | — | — |

The same cheap→frontier **empty-patch cascade** (escalate only the empties to Opus) measures **55.6% on the full
SWE-bench Verified (500)** — official `swebench` gold eval, conformant, ~56× cheaper than frontier-only — which
**beats** the Lite cascade (51.3%); the pattern generalizes across both splits. SWE-bench Verified cost is an
**estimate** (per-instance cost not captured in predictions). LiveCodeBench (n=100, contamination-resistant
post-cutoff window) lifts **44% → 62%** via cost-cascade; caveats are honest: deepseek snapshot cutoff unpinned,
part of the lift is run-to-run variance (clean attributable lift +8 on the escalated tail), n=100 is directional
(not 1:1 with the official whole-release ~34%). Details in
[`packages/darwin-mode/bench/results/RESULTS.md`](packages/darwin-mode/bench/results/RESULTS.md) (§33) and

## FAQ

### What is MetaHarness?

MetaHarness is a CLI and browser Studio that turns any GitHub repo (or a
blank slate) into a custom AI agent harness. The output is a branded,
npm-publishable package with its own `npx <name>` CLI, MCP server, memory,
governance policy, and Ed25519 witness-signed releases. Runs on ten hosts:
Claude Code, Codex, pi.dev, Hermes, OpenClaw, RVM, Copilot, OpenCode,
GitHub Actions, and Prime Agent.

### How is MetaHarness different from an agent framework?

Frameworks help **developers** build agents. MetaHarness helps
**repositories** ship agents. The model is replaceable; the harness is
the product.

### Do I need to run a server?

No. The Studio is 100% client-side (GitHub Pages). The CLI runs locally.
There is no MetaHarness account, no hosted backend, no telemetry.

### Does it execute my code during analysis?

No. `metaharness analyze` and `metaharness genome` are deterministic
static-analysis only. Inferred build/test commands are marked
`trust: inferred · execution: disabled`.

### Which agent runtimes does it support?

Ten today: Claude Code, Codex, pi.dev, Hermes, OpenClaw, RVM, Copilot,
OpenCode, GitHub Actions, Prime Agent.

### What languages does it understand?

Rust, TypeScript / JavaScript, Python, and Go are detected
deterministically via lockfile and manifest probing. Lexical scoring is
the default; optional in-browser MiniLM embeddings via Transformers.js
boost recall for unusual repos.

### Is the output really npm-publishable?

Yes — the generated harness ships with `package.json`, `bin`, a working
CLI, and `harness validate` to gate releases. `harness sign` adds the
