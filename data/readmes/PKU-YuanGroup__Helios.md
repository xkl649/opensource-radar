<div align="center">
This repository is the official implementation of Helios, which is a breakthrough video generation model that achieves minute-scale, high-quality video synthesis at <strong>19.5 FPS on a single H100 GPU</strong> (about 10 FPS on a single Ascend NPU) —without relying on conventional long video anti-drifting strategies or standard video acceleration techniques.
</div>

<br>

## ✨ Highlights


1. **Without commonly used anti-drifting strategies** (e.g., self-forcing, error-banks, keyframe sampling, or inverted sampling), Helios generates minute-scale videos with high quality and strong coherence.

2. **Without standard acceleration techniques** (e.g., KV-cache, causal masking, sparse/linear attention, TinyVAE, progressive noise schedules, hidden-state caching, or quantization), Helios achieves 19.5 FPS in end-to-end inference on a single H100 GPU.

3. **We introduce optimizations that improve both training and inference throughput while reducing memory consumption,** enabling image-diffusion-scale batch sizes during training while fitting up to four 14B models within 80 GB of GPU memory.

> 💡Note: 
> * All three models share the same architecture, but Helios-Mid and Helios-Distilled use a more aggressive multi-scale sampling pipeline to achieve better efficiency.
> * Helios-Mid is an intermediate checkpoint generated in the process of distilling Helios-Base into Helios-Distilled, and may not meet expected quality.
> * For Image-to-Video or Video-to-Video, since training is based on Text-to-Video, these two functions may be slightly inferior to Text-to-Video. You may enable `is_skip_first_chunk` if you find the first few chunks are static or imporve the value of `image_noise_sigma_min`, `image_noise_sigma_max`, `video_noise_sigma_min`, and `video_noise_sigma_max`.

## 🚀 Inference


Helios uses an autoregressive approach that generates **33 frames per chunk**. For optimal performance, `num_frames` should be set to a multiple of `33`. If a non-multiple value is provided, it will be automatically rounded up to the nearest multiple of 33.

**Example frame counts for different video lengths:**

| num_frames | Adjusted Frames | 24 FPS | 16 FPS |
|------------|-----------------|--------|--------|
| 1449       | 1452 (33×44)    | ~60s (1min) | ~90s (1min 30s) |
| 720        | 726 (33×22)     | ~30s | ~45s |
| 240        | 264 (33×8)      | ~11s | ~16s |
| 129        | 132 (33×4)      | ~5.5s | ~8s |
| 81         | 99  (33×3)      | ~4s | ~6s |

### Run the model

We provide inference scripts for all models covering text-to-video, image-to-video, and video-to-video in this [directory](./scripts/inference).

### ✨ Group Offloading to Save VRAM

Helios supports group offloading to significantly reduce VRAM consumption, allowing you to run on GPU with limited memory footprint. For more details on the underlying mechanics, please refer to the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/optimization/memory#group-offloading).

The Helios model below requires `~6GB of VRAM`.

### ✨ CNAPS.AI Online Workflow

[CNAPS.AI](https://cnaps.ai/) has provided a flexible workflow of Helios on their online inference service platform. You can check their [blog 1](https://docs.cnaps.ai/helios-base) and [blog 2](https://docs.cnaps.ai/helios-distilled) for an easy tutorial and more adaptable parameters to better use Helios there.

[![CNAPS.AI](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d04d94d0-1e64-4200-b76e-96cc597ae37f)](https://docs.cnaps.ai/helios-base)

## 🗝️ Training

We use a three-stage progressive pipeline, all the setting can be found [here](./scripts/training/configs/). Stage-1 (Base) performs architectural adaptation: we apply Unified History Injection, Easy Anti-Drifting, and Multi-Term Memory Patchification to convert the bidirectional pretrained model into an autoregressive generator. Stage-2 (Mid) targets token compression by introducing Pyramid Unified Predictor Corrector, which aggressively reduces the number of noisy tokens and thus the overall computation. Stage-3 (Distilled) applies Adversarial Hierarchical Distillation, reducing the sampling steps from 50 to 3 and eliminating the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG). Throughout training, we apply dynamic shifting to all timestep-dependent operations to match the noise schedule to the latent size.

### Data Preparation

Please refer to [this guide](./tools/offload_data/README.md) for how to obtain the training data required by Helios. And we prepare a toy training data [here](https://huggingface.co/BestWishYsh/HeliosBench-Weights/tree/main/demo_data).

### Run the model

```bash
# Use DDP
bash scripts/training/train_ddp.sh

# or

# Use DeepSpeed
bash scripts/training/train_deepspeed.sh
```

Training configuration can be adjusted in `scripts/training/configs`. You can use `scripts/training/compare_yaml.py` to check for configuration completeness or differences between stages.

### Model Merging

After training, you can use this [script](./tools/merge_lora_for_helios.py) to merge all the checkpoints and obtain the final safetensors file, similar to [this](https://huggingface.co/BestWishYsh/Helios-Distilled/tree/main/transformer).


## 📊 HeliosBench

HeliosBench is a specialized benchmark for real-time long-video generation, please refer to [this guide](./eval/README.md) for how to eval your own model.
