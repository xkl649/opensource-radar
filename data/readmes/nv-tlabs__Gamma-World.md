## 📖 Abstract

World models for interactive video generation have largely focused on single-agent settings, where future observations are generated from a single control signal. However, many generated environments require multi-agent interaction: multiple players, robots, or embodied agents act simultaneously within a shared space. Scaling world models to such settings requires a principled multi-agent design: agents should remain independently controllable, permutation-symmetric, and support efficient inference while maintaining consistency across time and perspectives.

We present <strong>γ-World</strong>, a generative multi-agent world model for interactive simulation. γ-World introduces <strong>Simplex Rotary Agent Encoding</strong>, a parameter-free extension of 3D RoPE that represents agents as vertices of a regular simplex in rotary angle space. This gives each agent a distinct phase while making all agents permutation-equivalent, enabling scalable agent identity without learned per-slot identities or a fixed agent ordering.

To avoid dense all-to-all attention across agents, we further propose <strong>Sparse Hub Attention</strong>, where learnable hub tokens mediate token interaction across agents, reducing cross-agent attention cost from quadratic to linear in the number of agents. For real-time rollout, we distill a full-context diffusion teacher into a causal student that generates temporal blocks sequentially with KV caching, enabling action-responsive generation at <strong>24 FPS</strong>.

### Two-Agent Interaction

Each agent is independently controllable while sharing the same evolving world.

### Four-Agent Generalization

Benefiting from the permutation-symmetric simplex agent encoding, γ-World generalizes from two to four players <strong>without additional training</strong>.

### Real-World Robotics Coordination

γ-World extends to real-world multi-robot coordination scenarios, demonstrating applicability beyond virtual environments.

## 🧠 Method

![Method overview](assets/method-overview.png)

γ-World takes synchronized observations and actions from multiple agents as input, tokenizes each agent stream with shared visual and action encoders, and generates future multi-agent rollouts with a causal multi-agent DiT. The model formulates the input with an explicit synchronized agent axis, encodes exchangeable agent identity using Simplex Rotary Agent Encoding, and routes cross-agent information through Sparse Hub Attention. During streaming inference, the causal student uses KV caches for past visual tokens and hub states to preserve block-causal generation while scaling efficiently with the number of agents.

### Simplex Rotary Agent Encoding

Simplex Rotary Agent Encoding is a parameter-free extension of 3D RoPE. Instead of assigning agents scalar indices or learned identity vectors, γ-World places them at the vertices of a regular simplex in rotary angle space. All agents have equal pairwise distances, so every pair is permutation-equivalent while each agent retains a distinct rotary phase.

### Sparse Hub Attention

Sparse Hub Attention routes cross-agent communication through a small set of learnable hub tokens. Agent tokens attend to their own stream and to the hubs; the hubs aggregate information across agents and broadcast it back. This preserves a shared communication pathway without dense pairwise interaction, reducing cross-agent attention from <strong>O(N²)</strong> to <strong>O(N)</strong>.

### Efficiency

Sparse Hub Attention achieves significantly lower latency and FLOPs as the number of agents increases, making γ-World more scalable beyond two players.
