## Installation

### Prerequisites before Installation

1.  **Domain Name:** You need a registered domain name (e.g., `yourdomain.com`).
2.  **DNS Configuration:** Before running the installation script, you **must** configure DNS A-record for your domain, pointing to the public IP address of the server where you'll install this system. Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain:
    - **Wildcard Record:** `A *.yourdomain.com` -> `YOUR_SERVER_IP`
3.  **VPS (Virtual Private Server):** A dedicated VPS with a public IP address is required. Home servers, shared hosting, or localhost setups are not supported.
    - **Operating System:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, 64-bit
    - For a minimal setup with **n8n, Monitoring, Databasus and Portainer**: **4 GB Memory / 2 CPU Cores / 40 GB Disk Space**
    - For running **all available services**: at least **20 GB Memory / 4 CPU Cores / 60 GB Disk Space**

### Running the Install

The recommended way to install is using the provided main installation script.

1.  Connect to your server via SSH.
2.  Run the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kossakovsky/selfhost-ai && cd selfhost-ai && sudo bash ./scripts/install.sh
    ```

This single command automates the entire setup process, including:

- Preparing your system (updates, firewall configuration, and basic security enhancements like brute-force protection).
- Installing Docker and Docker Compose (tools for running applications in isolated environments).
- Generating a configuration file (`.env`) with necessary secrets and your domain settings.
- Launching all the services.

During the installation, the script will prompt you for:

1.  Your **primary domain name** (Required, e.g., `yourdomain.com`). This is the domain for which you've configured the wildcard DNS record.
2.  Your **email address** (Required, used for service logins like Flowise, Supabase dashboard, Grafana, and for SSL certificate registration with Let's Encrypt).
3.  An optional **OpenAI API key** (Not required. If provided, it can be used by Supabase AI features and Crawl4ai. Press Enter to skip).
4.  Whether you want to **import ~300 ready-made n8n community workflows** (y/n, Optional. This can take 20-30 minutes, depending on your server and network speed).
5.  The **number of n8n workers** you want to run (Required, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4. This determines how many workflows can be processed in parallel. Each worker automatically gets its own dedicated task runner sidecar for executing Code nodes. Defaults to 1 if not specified).
6.  A **Service Selection Wizard** will then appear, allowing you to choose which of the available services (like Flowise, Supabase, Qdrant, Open WebUI, etc.) you want to deploy. Core services (Caddy, Postgres, Redis) will be set up to support your selections.

Upon successful completion, the script will display a summary report. This report contains the access URLs and credentials for the deployed services. **Save this information in a safe place!**

## Quick Start and Usage

After successful installation, your services are up and running! Here's how to get started:

1.  **Access Your Services:**
    The installation script provided a summary report with all access URLs and credentials. Please refer to that report. The main services will be available at the following addresses (replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain):

    - **n8n:** `n8n.yourdomain.com` (Log in with the email address you provided during installation and the initial password from the summary report. You may be prompted to change this password on first login.)
    - **Appsmith:** `appsmith.yourdomain.com` (Low-code app builder)
    - **ComfyUI:** `comfyui.yourdomain.com` (Node-based Stable Diffusion UI)
    - **Databasus:** `databasus.yourdomain.com`
    - **Dify:** `dify.yourdomain.com` (AI application development platform with comprehensive LLMOps capabilities)
    - **Docling:** `docling.yourdomain.com` (Universal document converter with REST API; web UI available at `/ui`)
    - **Flowise:** `flowise.yourdomain.com` (Log in with the email address you provided during installation and the initial password from the summary report.)
    - **Grafana:** `grafana.yourdomain.com`
    - **InvokeAI:** `invokeai.yourdomain.com` (Stable Diffusion studio; download a model via the Model Manager on first visit)

    - **NocoDB:** `nocodb.yourdomain.com`
    - **Ollama:** `ollama.yourdomain.com` (Optional local-LLM API; every request must send `Authorization: Bearer <OLLAMA_CADDY_API_TOKEN>`. A leaked token grants full control — including pulling/deleting models — not just inference.)
    - **Open WebUI:** `webui.yourdomain.com`
    - **PaddleOCR:** `paddleocr.yourdomain.com`
    - **Portainer:** `portainer.yourdomain.com` (Protected by Caddy basic auth; on first login, complete Portainer admin setup)
    - **Postiz:** `postiz.yourdomain.com`
    - **Prometheus:** `prometheus.yourdomain.com` (Typically used as a data source for Grafana)
    - **Qdrant:** `qdrant.yourdomain.com`
    - **RAGApp:** `ragapp.yourdomain.com`

    - **WAHA:** `waha.yourdomain.com` (WhatsApp HTTP API; engines: WEBJS, NOWEB, GOWS)
    - **Weaviate:** `weaviate.yourdomain.com`

### Optional Internal Utility: Python Runner

- **What it is**: An internal-only service to run your custom Python code inside the same Docker network as your other services (n8n, Postgres, Qdrant, etc.). No external ports are exposed, and it is not proxied by Caddy.
- **How to enable**: Select “Python Runner” in the Service Selection Wizard during install/update, or add the profile manually: `COMPOSE_PROFILES=...,python-runner`.
- **Where to put code**: Place your Python files in `python-runner/`. The default entry point is `python-runner/main.py`.
- **Dependencies**: Add them to `python-runner/requirements.txt`; they will be installed automatically on container start.

2.  **Explore n8n:**

    - Log in to your n8n instance. This is your central hub for workflow automation.
    - If you chose to import the community workflows during installation, you'll find over 300 examples in your "Workflows" section. These are a great way to learn and get ideas.
    - Start building your first workflow! You have access to over 400 integrations and powerful AI tools.

3.  **Utilize Integrated AI Tools:**

    - **Connect n8n with Vector Stores:** Use n8n to connect to Qdrant (accessible via its own endpoint if needed, typically `qdrant.yourdomain.com`), Supabase, or Weaviate (`weaviate.yourdomain.com`) to store and retrieve information for your AI tasks like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
    - **Build with Flowise:** Access Flowise at `flowise.yourdomain.com` to create AI agents and applications. You can trigger Flowise agents from n8n or vice-versa.
    - **Interact with Open WebUI:** Use Open WebUI at `webui.yourdomain.com` as a chat interface for your local AI models or n8n agents (e.g., using the n8n_pipe integration if configured).
    - **Configure LLMs:** If you wish to use large language models (LLMs) from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, or locally via Ollama (if installed), you can easily configure credentials and connections within n8n nodes or in services like Flowise and Open WebUI.

4.  **Check Monitoring (Optional):**
    - Visit Grafana (`grafana.yourdomain.com`) to see dashboards monitoring your system's performance (data sourced from Prometheus).
	

## Secure Access with Cloudflare Tunnel (Optional)

Cloudflare Tunnel provides zero-trust access to your services without exposing any ports on your server. All traffic is routed through Cloudflare's secure network, providing DDoS protection and hiding your server's IP address.

### Benefits
- **No exposed ports** - Ports 80/443 can be completely closed
- **DDoS protection** - Built-in Cloudflare protection
- **IP hiding** - Your server's real IP is never exposed
- **Zero-trust security** - Optional Cloudflare Access integration
- **No public IP required** - Works on private networks

### Setup Instructions

See the Cloudflare Tunnel guide: [cloudflare-instructions.md](cloudflare-instructions.md)


### Using Libraries in n8n Code Nodes (v2.0+)

n8n v2.0 uses external task runners to execute JavaScript and Python code in Code nodes. This setup pre-configures the following libraries via `n8n/Dockerfile.runner` and `n8n/n8n-task-runners.json`:

**JavaScript libraries**:
- **`cheerio`**: For parsing and manipulating HTML/XML (e.g., web scraping).
- **`axios`**: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to external APIs.
- **`moment`**: For parsing, validating, manipulating, and displaying dates/times.
- **`lodash`**: A utility library for common programming tasks (arrays, objects, strings, etc.).

### Pre-installed System Tools in n8n

The custom n8n Docker image (`n8n/Dockerfile.n8n`) includes the following system-level tools:

- **`ffmpeg`**: A powerful multimedia framework for converting, recording, and streaming audio and video. Use it via the [Execute Command](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executecommand/) node in n8n workflows for tasks like:
  - Converting video/audio formats (e.g., MP4 to MP3)
  - Extracting audio from video files
  - Resizing or compressing media files
  - Generating thumbnails from videos

## Upgrading

To update all components (n8n, Open WebUI, etc.) to their latest versions and incorporate the newest changes from this installer project:

```bash
make update
```

**For forks**: If you maintain a fork with custom changes and want to merge updates from upstream instead of resetting:

```bash
make git-pull
```

This script will:

1.  Fetch the latest updates for the installer from the Git repository.
2.  Temporarily stop the currently running services.
3.  Download the latest versions of the Docker images for all services.
4.  Ask if you want to re-run the n8n workflow import (useful if you skipped this during the initial installation or want to refresh the community workflows).
5.  Restart all services with the new updates.

### Custom Configuration That Survives Updates

`make update` resets tracked files (like `Caddyfile` and `docker-compose.yml`) to the latest version, so never edit them directly. Instead, use the dedicated extension points — the files you create there are gitignored, so they are preserved across updates:

- **Custom Caddy entries** (e.g. reverse proxy for a service running outside this stack): drop a `site-*.conf` file into `caddy-addon/`. It is imported automatically by the main Caddyfile. See [caddy-addon/README.md](caddy-addon/README.md) for examples.
- **Docker Compose overrides** (change any service property): create a `docker-compose.override.yml` in the project root. It is picked up automatically with the highest precedence.
- **Settings**: values you set in `.env` are preserved by the updater (except `GOST_NO_PROXY`, which is regenerated so it always covers newly added services).

## Cleaning up Docker

If you need to free up disk space, you can run the Docker cleanup command. This removes all unused Docker containers, images, and volumes.

```bash
make clean
```

This can be useful for removing old images and freeing up space, but be aware that it will remove all unused data.

- [Original Starter Kit](https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit) by the n8n team

## Troubleshooting

Here are solutions to common issues you might encounter:

### Sites not loading even after following the instructions

- **Symptom:** Your domains/sites do not open or return errors even though you completed all installation steps.
- **Likely cause:** Your VPS does not have enough resources for the set of services you selected.
- **What to try:**
  1. Check current CPU and RAM usage (e.g., with `top`/`htop`, `free -h`, and `docker stats`). If resources are saturated, upgrade the server or reduce the number of running services.
  2. Try a minimal configuration — start only `n8n` and verify it comes up. If it works in this minimal setup, enable other services gradually while monitoring the load.

### Temporary "Dangerous Site" Warning in Browser

- **Symptom:** Immediately after deploying the services, your browser (e.g., Chrome) might display a "Dangerous Site" or similar security warning when you try to access your services. This warning typically disappears after some time (e.g., within a few hours or by the next day).
- **Cause:** This can happen for a couple of reasons:
  1.  **Brief use of a self-signed certificate:** When Caddy (the web server managing your SSL certificates) starts up for a new domain, it might briefly use a temporary, self-signed certificate while it's in the process of requesting and obtaining a valid SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt.
  2.  **Delay in applying the new certificate:** There might also be a short delay before the newly obtained certificate from Let's Encrypt is fully applied and recognized by all systems.
- **Solution:** This is usually a temporary issue and resolves itself. Give it some time. If the warning persists for more than 24 hours, check your Caddy logs for any errors related to certificate acquisition and ensure your DNS settings are correctly pointing your domain to the server's IP address. You can also try clearing your browser's cache or using an incognito/private window to re-check.

### General Issues

- **VPN Conflicts:** Using a VPN might interfere with downloading Docker images. If you encounter issues pulling images, try temporarily disabling your VPN.
- **Server Requirements:** If you experience unexpected issues, ensure your server meets the minimum hardware and operating system requirements (including version) as specified in the "Prerequisites before Installation" section.

### Update Script Not Working

- **Symptom:** The `make update` command fails, shows errors, or doesn't apply the latest changes.
- **Cause:** This can happen if your local repository has diverged from the upstream, has uncommitted changes, or is in an inconsistent state.
- **Solution:** Run the following command to force-sync your local installation with the latest version:

  ```bash
  git config pull.rebase true && git fetch origin && git checkout main && git reset --hard "origin/main" && make update
  ```

  **Warning:** This will discard any local changes you've made to the installer files. If you've customized any scripts or configurations, back them up first.

## Tips & Tricks

### Accessing Files on the Server

The installer creates a `shared` folder (by default, located in the same directory where you ran the installation script). This folder is accessible by the n8n application.
When you build automations in n8n that need to read or write files on your server, use the path `/data/shared` inside your n8n workflows. This path in n8n points to the `shared` folder on your server.

**n8n components that interact with the server's filesystem:**

- [Read/Write Files from Disk](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.filesreadwrite/)
- [Local File Trigger](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.localfiletrigger/) (To start workflows when files change)
- [Execute Command](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executecommand/) (To run command-line tools)

## Telemetry

This installer collects anonymous usage statistics via [Scarf](https://scarf.sh) to help improve the project. **No personal data is collected.**

Data collected:
- Event type (install/update start/complete)
- Installer version
- Selected services
- OS type (e.g., ubuntu-24.04)
- Random installation ID (to correlate start/complete events)
- Country (determined by Scarf from IP, not stored by us)

To opt out, add to your `.env` file after installation:
```
SCARF_ANALYTICS=false
```
