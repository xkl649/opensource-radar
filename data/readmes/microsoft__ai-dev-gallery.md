## ❓ FAQs
- **Q: Is a Microsoft account necessary to use the app?**
  - **A:** No, the app does NOT require a Microsoft account for use.
- **Q: Can I use the app without an internet connection?**
  - **A:** Yes, the app works offline since the AI models are downloaded locally. However, you will need to be online to download additional AI models from Hugging Face or GitHub.
- **Q: What AI models are available in the app?**
  - **A:** The app features popular open source models and APIs from the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/ai/overview">Microsoft Foundry on Windows</a>. When executing a sample, you can select which model you want to use.
- **Q: Is the app's source code accessible? Can I contribute new samples?**
  - **A:** Yes, the app is completely open-source, and its code is accessible on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/AI-Dev-Gallery). Feel free to contribute by <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/AI-Dev-Gallery/issues">filing an issue</a>, or submitting a PR and one of our moderators will review it.
- **Q: Where can I provide feedback?**
  - **A:** Feel free to give us feedback or [open an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/AI-Dev-Gallery/issues/new) on our GitHub repository.
- **Q: Do I need to run the app just to try a single sample?**
