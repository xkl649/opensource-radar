This repository contains the official implementation of the paper: [PartCrafter: Structured 3D Mesh Generation via Compositional Latent Diffusion Transformers](https://wgsxm.github.io/projects/partcrafter/). 
PartCrafter is a structured 3D generative model that jointly generates multiple parts and objects from a single RGB image in one shot. 
Here is our [Project Page](https://wgsxm.github.io/projects/partcrafter).

Feel free to contact me (linyuchen@stu.pku.edu.cn) or open an issue if you have any questions or suggestions.

## 🔧 Installation
We use `torch-2.5.1+cu124` and `python-3.11`. But it should also work with other versions. Create a conda environment with the following command (optional):
```
conda create -n partcrafter python=3.11.13
conda activate partcrafter
pip install torch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 torchaudio==2.5.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
```
Then, install other dependencies with the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/wgsxm/PartCrafter.git
cd PartCrafter
bash settings/setup.sh
```
If you do not have root access and use conda environment, you can install required graphics libraries with the following command:
```
conda install -c conda-forge libegl libglu pyopengl
```
We test the above installation on Debian 12 with NVIDIA H20 GPUs. For Windows users, you can try to set up the environment according to [this pull request](https://github.com/wgsxm/PartCrafter/pull/24) and [this fork](https://github.com/JackDainzh/PartCrafter-Windows/tree/windows-main). We sincerely thank [JackDainzh](https://github.com/JackDainzh) for contributing to the Windows support! 

## 💡 Quick Start
### 3D Part-Level Object Generation
<p align="center">
    <img width="90%" alt="pipeline", src="./assets/robot.gif">
</p>

Generate a 3D part-level object from an image:
```
python scripts/inference_partcrafter.py \
  --image_path assets/images/np3_2f6ab901c5a84ed6bbdf85a67b22a2ee.png \
  --num_parts 3 --tag robot --render
```
The required model weights will be automatically downloaded:
- PartCrafter model from [wgsxm/PartCrafter](https://huggingface.co/wgsxm/PartCrafter) → pretrained_weights/PartCrafter
- RMBG model from [briaai/RMBG-1.4](http://huggingface.co/briaai/RMBG-1.4) → pretrained_weights/RMBG-1.4

The generated results will be saved to `./results/robot`. We provide several example images from Objaverse and ABO in `./assets/images`. Their filenames start with recommended number of parts, e.g., `np3` which means 3 parts. You can also try other part count for the same input images. 

Specify `--rmbg` if you use custom images. **This will remove the background of the input image and resize it appropriately.**

### VLM-Based Part Suggestion
Instead of manually specifying `--num_parts`, you can use a VLM to automatically suggest the number of parts:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key python scripts/inference_partcrafter.py \
  --image_path assets/images/np3_2f6ab901c5a84ed6bbdf85a67b22a2ee.png \
  --part_suggest --tag robot --rmbg --render
```
This sends the image to a VLM (default: `gemini-3-flash-preview`) which analyzes the object and suggests an appropriate part count. You can override the provider or model:
```
--part_provider gemini --part_model gemini-3-flash-preview
```

### Style Transfer for Real-World Images
PartCrafter was trained on rendered images from Objaverse. When using real-world photos, you can apply style transfer to bridge the domain gap:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key python scripts/inference_partcrafter.py \
  --image_path real_photo.jpg \
  --num_parts 4 --style_transfer --rmbg --render
```
This converts the input photo to an Objaverse-style 3D rendering (default model: `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview`) before feeding it to the pipeline. The stylized image is saved as `styled_input.png` in the output directory. You can override the provider or model:
```
--style_provider gemini --style_model gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview
```

Both features can be combined:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key python scripts/inference_partcrafter.py \
  --image_path real_photo.jpg \
  --part_suggest --style_transfer --rmbg --render
```

The provider architecture is extensible -- adding a new provider (e.g., OpenAI) requires only a new file in `src/utils/providers/` implementing `suggest_num_parts()` and/or `stylize_for_objaverse()`.

### 3D Scene Generation
<p align="center">
    <img width="90%" alt="pipeline", src="./assets/dining_room.gif">
</p>

Generate a 3D scene from an image:
```
python scripts/inference_partcrafter_scene.py \
  --image_path assets/images_scene/np6_0192a842-531c-419a-923e-28db4add8656_DiningRoom-31158.png \
  --num_parts 6 --tag dining_room --render
```
The required model weights will be automatically downloaded:
- PartCrafter-Scene model from [wgsxm/PartCrafter-Scene](https://huggingface.co/wgsxm/PartCrafter-Scene) → pretrained_weights/PartCrafter-Scene

The generated results will be saved to `./results/dining_room`. We provide several example images from 3D-Front in `./assets/images_scene`. Their filenames start with recommended number of parts, e.g., `np3` which means 3 parts. You can also try other part count for the same input images. 

The `--part_suggest` and `--style_transfer` flags are also available for scene-level generation.

## 💻 System Requirements
A CUDA-enabled GPU with at least 8GB VRAM. You can reduce number of parts or number of tokens to save GPU memory. We set the number of tokens per part to `1024` on object level and `2048` on scene level by default for better quality. 

## 📊 Dataset
Please refer to [Dataset README](./datasets/README.md) to download and preprocess the dataset. To generate a minimal dataset, you can run:
```
python datasets/preprocess/preprocess.py --input assets/objects --output preprocessed_data
```
This script preprocesses GLB files in `./assets/objects` and saves the preprocessed data to `./preprocessed_data`. We provide a pseudo data configuration [here](./datasets/object_part_configs.json), which makes use of the minimal preprocessed data and is compatible with the training settings.

## 🦾 Training
To train PartCrafter from scratch, you first need to download TripoSG from [VAST-AI/TripoSG](https://huggingface.co/VAST-AI/TripoSG) and store the weights in `./pretrained_models/TripoSG`. 
```
huggingface-cli download VAST-AI/TripoSG --local-dir pretrained_weights/TripoSG
```

Our training scripts are suitable for training with 8 H20 GPUs (96G VRAM each). Currently, we only finetune the DiT of TripoSG and keep the VAE fixed. But you can also finetune the VAE of TripoSG, which should improve the quality of the generated 3D parts. PartCrafter is compatible with all 3D object generative models based on vector sets such as [Hunyuan3D-2.1](https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/Hunyuan3D-2.1). We warmly welcome pull requests from the community. 

We provide several training configurations [here](./configs). You should modify the path of dataset configs in the training config files, which is currently set to `./datasets/object_part_configs.json`. 

If you use `wandb`, you should also modify the `WANDB_API_KEY` in the training script. If you have trouble connecting to `wandb`, try `export WANDB_BASE_URL=https://api.bandw.top`. 

Train PartCrafter from TripoSG:
```
bash scripts/train_partcrafter.sh --config configs/mp8_nt512.yaml --use_ema \
  --gradient_accumulation_steps 4 \
  --output_dir output_partcrafter \
  --tag scaleup_mp8_nt512
```

Finetune PartCrafter with larger number of parts:
```
bash scripts/train_partcrafter.sh --config configs/mp16_nt512.yaml --use_ema \
  --gradient_accumulation_steps 4 \
  --output_dir output_partcrafter \
  --load_pretrained_model scaleup_mp8_nt512 \
  --load_pretrained_model_ckpt 10 \
  --tag scaleup_mp16_nt512
```

Finetune PartCrafter with more tokens:
```
bash scripts/train_partcrafter.sh --config configs/mp16_nt1024.yaml --use_ema \
  --gradient_accumulation_steps 4 \
  --output_dir output_partcrafter \
  --load_pretrained_model scaleup_mp16_nt512 \
  --load_pretrained_model_ckpt 10 \
  --tag scaleup_mp16_nt1024
```
