# Rinkhals

Rinkhals is a custom firmware for some Anycubic Kobra 3D printers (specifically the ones running Kobra OS, see below for the details).

The goal of this project is to expand existing Anycubic features with better compatibility, apps and more.
I will likely not support all use cases, like running vanilla Klipper or your specific feature / plugin.

By using Rinkhals, you will keep all stock Anycubic features (print screen, Anycubic tools, calibration, ...) and get even more, like:
- Mainsail, Fluidd (with Moonraker)
- USB camera support in Mainsail, Fluidd
- Prints from Orca will show the print screen
- SSH access for customization (user: **root**, password: **rockchip**)
- OTA Rinkhals updates
- [Apps system](https://github.com/jbatonnet/Rinkhals.apps) (OctoEverywhere, Cloudflare, Tailscale, ...)

Latest version will likely support the two latest firmwares from Anycubic, unless specified. For older firmware please check older releases or our [firmware archive](https://rinkhals.firmwareforge.org).
Here are the supported GoKlipper / K3-family printers and firmwares with the latest Rinkhals release:
| Model  | Tested firmwares | Notes |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Kobra 3 (+ combo) | `2.4.5` `2.4.6.7` |
| Kobra 2 Pro | `3.1.2.3` `3.1.4` | Only with mainboard [Trigorilla Spe **B** v1.0.x](https://1coderookie.github.io/Kobra2ProInsights/hardware/mainboard/#trigorilla_spe_b_v10x-stock-new-revision). `3.1.4` seems to be buggy for some people |
| Kobra S1 (+ combo) | `2.6.0.0` `2.7.0.9` |
| Kobra 3 Max (+ combo) | `2.5.1.7` `2.5.2.8` |
| Kobra 3 V2 (+ combo) | `1.1.0.4` `1.1.2.8` |
| Kobra S1 Max (+ combo) | `2.6.6` `2.6.9.3` |

🔴 - in testing, not yet ready

The K4-family currently has a separate status:

| Model | Status | Notes |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Kobra X | Not supported | Uses the `KlipperC++` / K4 software base and is currently blocked by SWU RSA signature verification. See the [Kobra X documentation](https://jbatonnet.github.io/Rinkhals/printers/kobra-x/) for details. |

## Kobra X status

Some Kobra X firmware packages are publicly available and the SWU password has also been recovered.

However, Anycubic moved from the K3 software base (GoKlipper) to a K4 software base using a C++ Klipper port. Because of this, Kobra X support is not expected to be a simple port of the current Rinkhals stack.

In addition, the SWU update flow requires a trusted certificate for package acceptance. Until a reliable bypass is discovered, SWU-based firmware injection similar to Rinkhals is not currently feasible on Kobra X.

## General Information

## Rinkhals installation

> [!WARNING]
> **Make sure you're confident tweaking your printer and you understand what you're doing. I'm not responsible if you brick your printer (even if there's some [documentation](https://jbatonnet.github.io/Rinkhals/printers/recover-boot-issues/)) about that)**

> [!CAUTION]
> Many users want to change their Klipper printer configuration (the printer.cfg file). I strongly advise not modifying the stock printer configuration. Rinkhals offers additional protection you don't have while modifying directly your printer configuration. **I won't offer any support** and **your printer might not work properly or not boot anymore**. Check the documentation for more information: [Printer configuration](https://jbatonnet.github.io/Rinkhals/Rinkhals/printer-configuration/)

A [quick start guide](https://jbatonnet.github.io/Rinkhals/guides/rinkhals-quick-start/) is available to get Rinkhals up and running on your printer.

There are two options to install Rinkhals:
1. Use the provided Rinkhals installer (named **install-*.swu**)
2. Install the raw swu directly (named **update-*.swu**)

Either way, you'll need to:
- Download the release / file you want from the [Releases](https://github.com/jbatonnet/Rinkhals/releases) page
- Rename the downloaded SWU file as **update.swu**
- Copy it in a directory named **aGVscF9zb3Nf** (or **update** for the Kobra 2 Pro in certain conditions) on a FAT32 USB drive (MBR, GPT is not supported)
- Plug the USB drive in your printer

More detailed information about the Rinkhals installer are available in the [documentation](https://jbatonnet.github.io/Rinkhals/Rinkhals/rinkhals-installer/)

For more information about installation, firmware updates and details about specific situations, go to https://jbatonnet.github.io/Rinkhals/Rinkhals/installation-and-firmware-updates/

    <img width="48" src="https://github.com/jbatonnet/Rinkhals/blob/master/icon.png?raw=true" />
</p>


## Touch UI

After installation, Rinkhals provides a touch UI accessible from the printer screen when you tap the Settings icon, then tap Rinkhals.

This UI allows you to manage installed apps, trigger an OTA update, reboot your printer and much more. This will allow you to customize your experience and keep the printer memory as low as needed based on your needs.

## Rinkhals Installer

From the release pages, you'll find the installer-\*.swu files for your printer model. This is an interactive touch tool to install and update Rinkhals and system firmware updates.

You can find more information in [the documentation](https://jbatonnet.github.io/Rinkhals/Rinkhals/rinkhals-installer/)

## Apps system

> [!WARNING]
> Those printers are quite weak in terms of CPU and Memory. Every additional app / feature and client you connect to the web interface will make the experience slower and might end up in crashes.<br />
> Having said that, running your printer with Moonraker, 1\~2 apps and 1\~2 connected clients should work fine.

An apps system is provided in Rinkhals. It allows for the users to easily add some features to their printer. Some default ones are provided and other are available on separate repos like:
- https://github.com/jbatonnet/Rinkhals.apps (Tailscale, Cloudflare, OctoApp companion, some progress on vanilla Klipper, ...)
- https://github.com/basvd/Rinkhals.WebUI (a web interface for Rinkhals)

Instructions on how to install or develop apps are on the other repo as well.
