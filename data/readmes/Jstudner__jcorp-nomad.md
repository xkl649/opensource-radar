> **Mk4 Release** - A big one. Full offline Wikipedia support, a redesigned case, and a long list of stability fixes under the hood. This update touches both firmware and frontend, so a reflash is required coming from Mk3. Still semi-stable while I iron out edge cases, but everything core is working well.

## What is Nomad

Jcorp Nomad is an open-source offline media server designed for travel, remote work, classrooms, camping, and more. It runs entirely on an ESP32-S3, creates a local Wi-Fi hotspot, and serves media through a browser interface. Multiple users can access separate media streams simultaneously, all without internet access.

This project is compact, easy to modify, and includes optional 3D-printable hardware. Both firmware and web interface are fully open-source.

## Get a Nomad

### Build It Yourself (Recommended)

I strongly recommend building your own Nomad. It's not a very difficult project, if you can follow instructions and plug in a USB cable, you can do it. The parts are cheap, widely available, and the whole build takes under an hour. See Hardware Requirements and Quick Start below. If nothing else please check out the DIY option before purchasing. 

### Buy a Prebuilt

That said, I also won't say no to money. If you'd rather skip the DIY and get a ready-to-go unit, prebuilt Nomads are available at **[nomad.jcorptech.net](https://nomad.jcorptech.net)**.

Every Nomad, whether you build it or buy it, runs the same open-source firmware and web interface. When new features and updates are released, you can always flash the latest code yourself to stay up to date. This project isn't going anywhere.

## Mk4 Highlights

### Offline Wikipedia & Archive Support (ZIM)
- Browse and search full offline Wikipedia (and other ZIM archives like Gutenberg and TED) directly from the SD card
- Search is fast even on massive archives, the companion [Nomad Tools](https://github.com/Jstudner/Nomad-Tools) app prebuilds a compact index on your PC, so the device never has to search the raw multi-gigabyte file itself
- Embedded videos and epub books inside archives play/read right in the browser
- Works with zero extra UI cost if you don't use it, no archives on the card means the feature stays completely out of the way
- Currently tested with Gutenburg epubs, TedX Videos, and wikipedia from the tiny 0.8 file all the way to the 140gb maxi with images. 

### Redesigned Case
<p align="center">
  <img src="NomadMk4Explode.png" alt="Nomad Mk4 exploded case view" width="700">
</p>

- New case slides together **front-to-back** instead of the old top-to-bottom design
- No more direct pressure on the screen, which was a common cause of cracked/broken screens on the old case
- Buttons stay exposed on the outside, so you can still flash firmware or hit the boot button without disassembling anything

- Based on a remix of [ESP32 C6 with LCD Screen Enclosure Case](https://makerworld.com/en/models/2121443-esp32-c6-with-lcd-screen-enclosure-case) on MakerWorld by [**Adrian**](https://makerworld.com/en/@user_1765744671), full credit to the original design this was based off of.

### Indexing & Stability
- Root-caused and fixed a long-standing random reboot bug tied to files over 2GB, this was the actual cause of crashes on image-heavy Wikipedia pages and big movie scrubbing
- Fixed a heap-corruption crash that could hit when indexing and refreshing SD totals at the same time
- Boot-time indexing now only re-scans when files have actually changed, instead of a full scan on every boot
- Removed the screens loading spinner that was silently forcing a full-screen redraw every loop, pulling it out made the whole device noticeably more stable

### Reader & Memory Improvements
- Comic and PDF readers now free old pages from memory as you scroll, fixing crashes on long comics and scanned PDFs
- PDF viewer shows a real loading percentage instead of a blank screen
- Cleaned out a bunch of dead code and unused libraries that were loading on every Books page

### UI & Admin Updates
- Unified header and button styling across pages so themes apply consistently everywhere
- Fixed several dark mode readability bugs (unreadable resume text, buttons that ignored custom themes, etc.)
- Admin panel settings are now gated behind a login
- Fixed a stuck brightness slider caused by an out-of-range default value

### Default Themes (28)

Default Blue, Forest Night, Cherry Blossom, Mocha Latte, Ocean Depths,
Autumn Leaves, Lavender Fields, Sunset Horizon, Coral Reef, Mountain Mist,
Jade Garden, Desert Sand, Arctic Aurora, DeLorean, Midnight Code, 90s Retro,
Mint Breeze, Rose Gold, Crimson Night, Emerald Dream, Royal Purple,
Copper Sunset, Sapphire Sea, Peach Cream, Slate Storm, Lime Zest,
Burgundy Wine, Teal Oasis

## Hardware Compatibility

Nomad is built specifically for the **Waveshare ESP32-S3 Dev Board (1.47" LCD version)**. Due to the number of low-level tricks used to squeeze this much functionality out of the hardware, it is difficult to get Nomad running on other boards.

There are a few community forks that target other ESP32 boards, but your mileage will vary. I'm also actively working on a **Nomad Lite** version with wider board compatibility, focused on basic streaming without all the advanced features.

---

## Hardware Requirements

- **Waveshare ESP32-S3 Dev Board (1.47" LCD version)**
  [Amazon Link](https://amzn.to/4ktB6oT)

- **FAT32 microSD card (16-128GB recommended, up to 2TB)**
  [Amazon Link](https://amzn.to/44tM1c4)

- **SD-Card Extender (optional, 3DP case compatible)**
  [Amazon Link](https://amzn.to/45IWIJz)

- **USB power source**
- **Optional:** 3D-printed enclosure (STL files included)

## Flash It From Your Browser

If you would rather skip Arduino IDE entirely, **[nomadflash.jcorptech.net](https://nomadflash.jcorptech.net)** does the setup from a browser tab. The firmware is already compiled, so there is nothing to install and no library versions to match.

It covers three things:

- **Flash the firmware.** Plug Nomad into a USB port, pick a build, and it writes the bootloader, partition table and app in one image. Takes about a minute.
- **Set up the SD card.** Copies the web interface onto the card and creates the media folders with the exact names the firmware looks for. There is an optional test set of placeholder content if you want to see every page working before you load your own media.
- **Update an existing card.** Replaces only the interface files and leaves your media alone. (still wip)

Both the main and experimental builds are there, and each is offered for both boards:

- **USB-A** for the ESP32-S3-LCD-1.47
- **USB-C** for the ESP32-S3-LCD-1.47B

Pick the one matching the connector on your board. The two differ only in which pin drives the LCD backlight.

Formatting the card is the one step it cannot do, because a web page has no access to drives or partitions. The site prints the exact command for Windows, macOS or Linux instead. This branch needs **FAT32**, and will not work with anything else.

**Requires Chrome, Edge or Opera on a desktop.** It uses Web Serial and the File System Access API, which Firefox and Safari do not implement, and neither one works on iOS or Android.

## 3D Printed Case Files

The Mk4 default case is a remix of [ESP32 C6 with LCD Screen Enclosure Case](https://makerworld.com/en/models/2121443-esp32-c6-with-lcd-screen-enclosure-case) on MakerWorld, credit to [**Adrian**](https://makerworld.com/en/@user_1765744671) for the original design. It's a front-to-back slide design that keeps pressure off the screen while still exposing the buttons for firmware access.

- Mk4 case files: in this repo
- Original Mk3 top/bottom case (still works, just more prone to screen pressure): [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7223398)

## What's Next

**Nomad Lite** - A stripped-down version of Nomad with wider board compatibility, focused on core streaming features. In active development now that Mk4 is out.

**Nomad Manager** - A companion application for Nomad that integrates with Jellyfin to handle automated media downcoding and transfers, and builds the offline archive indexes used by the ZIM reader. Keep your Nomad stocked and ready to go without manual file management.

**Gallion** - A larger-scale sibling to Nomad, built on more capable hardware. Gallion is designed to handle everything that couldn't fit on Nomad's current platform > ROM emulation, 4k video, and expanded media compatibility across the board. The current version is [here](https://github.com/Jstudner/Gallion).

---

## Project Inspiration

Inspired by my experience running a Jellyfin server, I wanted a portable, low-cost solution for offline media streaming. Challenges with SBCs (Raspberry Pi, etc.) included high power usage, heat, and instability.

Nomad focuses on delivering:

- Offline access
- Wide device compatibility
- Simple frontend for media browsing and playback
- Multiple user support
- High customization potential

The ESP32-S3 provides enough performance to handle these requirements efficiently, in a pocket-sized form factor.
