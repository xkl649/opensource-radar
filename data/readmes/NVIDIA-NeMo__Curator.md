### Use NeMo Curator when…

- You need **repeatable curation pipelines** — not one-off notebooks or ad-hoc scripts.
- You need **GPU and distributed execution** for data-heavy stages (dedupe, classification, embedding, inference).
- You need **modality-aware building blocks** for text, image, video, or audio.
- You want **recipes that map to NVIDIA training workflows** like Nemotron and Nemotron-CC.

---

## Quick Start

Three paths, depending on what you're trying to do. Each path is self-contained.

NeMo Curator uses [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for installation. Install it once:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Path A — CPU smoke test (no GPU required)

Verify your environment and run a tiny text pipeline.

```bash
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install "nemo-curator[text_cpu]"
python -c "import nemo_curator; print(nemo_curator.__version__)"
```

### Path B — GPU text pipeline (CUDA 12, supported Linux)

The bundled quickstart starts Ray, downloads a Hugging Face model, and runs a sentiment classification pipeline on GPU.

**Prerequisites:** CUDA 12 toolkit, NVIDIA driver supporting CUDA 12, Linux x86_64, ~16 GB GPU memory, network access to Hugging Face.

```bash
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Curator/main/requirements/text_cuda12-overrides.txt
uv pip install \
  --override text_cuda12-overrides.txt \
  --torch-backend cu129 \
  --extra-index-url https://wheels.vllm.ai/0.22.0/cu129 \
  "nemo-curator[text_cuda12]"
python tutorials/quickstart.py
```

Standard `pip install` is not supported for `text_cuda12` because vLLM and
RAPIDS declare incompatible Numba requirements. The supported `uv pip install`
command above applies Curator's tested override. Any `uv pip install` command
that includes `text_cuda12`, including `nemo-curator[all]`, needs the override
file. From a source checkout, `uv sync --extra text_cuda12` and `uv sync
--extra all` apply the project override automatically.

### Path C — Docker (recommended for video and audio)

Video and audio pipelines depend on system codec libraries; the published container ships them preconfigured.

- Container: [nemo-curator on NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/nemo-curator)
- Setup instructions: [Installation Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/curator/latest/get-started/installation)

## Why NeMo Curator

### Proven at scale: Nemotron

NeMo Curator powers the data pipelines behind [NVIDIA Nemotron](https://developer.nvidia.com/nemotron) models. The [Nemotron-4 pre-training dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16819) was curated using NeMo Curator's text pipeline across 8+ trillion tokens of multilingual web data — quality filtering, deduplication, and domain classification at scale.

The [Nemotron-CC curation pipeline](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Nemotron/tree/main/src/nemotron/recipes/data/curation/nemotron-cc) uses NeMo Curator end-to-end — from Common Crawl extraction through language ID, exact/fuzzy/substring deduplication, ensemble quality classification, and LLM-based synthetic data generation — to reproduce the [Nemotron-CC datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/Nemotron-CC-v2). The SDG stage is available as an [in-repo tutorial](tutorials/synthetic/nemotron_cc/).

### Benchmark results

NeMo Curator leverages NVIDIA RAPIDS™ (cuDF, cuML, cuGraph) with Ray to scale across multi-node, multi-GPU environments. Numbers below are from the throughput study published in the [scaling docs](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/curator/latest/about/concepts/scaling/throughput); see the source for full methodology, software versions, and baselines.

| Metric | Workload | Hardware | Baseline | NeMo Curator |
|--------|----------|---------|----------|--------------|
| Fuzzy dedupe speedup | RedPajama v2 subset | 3× H100 80 GB nodes | CPU-based alternative | 10.7 h → 0.65 h (**~16×**) |
| Total cost of ownership | RedPajama v2 subset | 3× H100 80 GB nodes | CPU-based alternative | $315 → $190 (**~40% lower**) |
| GPU scaling (1→4 nodes) | RedPajama v2 subset | 1, 2, 4 × H100 80 GB nodes | Single-node run | 2.05 h → 1.01 h → 0.50 h |

> Token counts and exact subset sizes vary across published panels; treat per-panel labels in the source as authoritative.

### Quality improvements

In ablation studies using a 357M-parameter GPT model trained on curated Common Crawl data, NeMo Curator's pipeline stages — text cleaning, deduplication, and quality filtering — produced progressive improvements in zero-shot downstream task accuracy.

## How It Works

NeMo Curator pipelines are composed of **stages**, each handling a discrete curation task (load, filter, dedupe, classify, transform, write). Stages stream **tasks** through the pipeline and are executed by a pluggable **executor**.

- **Stages** declare their own resource requirements (CPU cores, GPU memory, replicas).
- **Pipelines** chain stages; the executor auto-scales replicas per stage to match throughput across the chain.
- **Streaming execution** overlaps CPU and GPU work so all stages run concurrently — typical pipelines keep GPU workers >99% busy after warm-up.
- **Executors** run the pipeline: the [XennaExecutor](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/curator/latest/api/reference/api-reference/executors/xenna-executor) (Cosmos-Xenna) is the production default, with experimental Ray-based backends also available — same pipeline definition, different runtime.
- **Modality plug-ins** (text, image, video, audio) provide ready-made stages on top of the same core abstractions.

See the [scaling concepts](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/curator/latest/about/concepts/scaling) for an end-to-end walkthrough.
