## Why SD.Next?

SD.Next is feature-rich open-source AI art generation platform with a focus on performance, flexibility, and user experience.

In addition to supporting all popular [workflows](#supported-workflows), a wide range of [platforms](#supported-platforms-and-hardware) and [models](#supported-ai-models), SD.Next includes many features not found in other WebUIs, such as:

- Support for many [Diffusion models](https://vladmandic.github.io/sdnext-docs/Model-Support/)!  
- **Automatic model download**: simply select a model from the list of reference models and it will be downloaded and ready to use  
  Or download and add your own models and they will be automatically detected and available in the UI  
- **SDNQ**: State-of-the-Art model quantization engine
  Use pre-quantized or run with quantization on-the-fly for up to 4x VRAM reduction with no or minimal quality and performance impact  
- **Balanced Offload**: Dynamically balance CPU and GPU memory to run larger models on limited hardware
- **Caption and Enhance** with 25+ built-in **LLM** and **VLM** models, **OpenCLiP** models, **Tagger** with **WaifuDiffusion** and **DeepDanbooru** models  
- **Image Processing** with full image correction color-grading suite of tools  
- [Multi-platform](https://vladmandic.github.io/sdnext-docs/Platforms/)!  
  Platform specific auto-detection and tuning performed on install  
- Fully **Localized** to ~15 languages and with support for many [UI themes](https://vladmandic.github.io/sdnext-docs/Themes/)!
- **Desktop** and **mobile** interfaces
- Built in **installer** with automatic updates and dependency management
