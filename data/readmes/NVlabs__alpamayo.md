## Installation

### 1. Install uv (if not already installed)

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### 2. Set up the environment

```bash
uv venv ar1_venv
source ar1_venv/bin/activate
uv sync --active
```

### 3. Authenticate with HuggingFace

The model requires access to gated resources. Request access here:

> 💡 **Tip**: For more details on HuggingFace authentication, see the [official documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/guides/cli).

## Running Inference

### Test script

NOTE: This script will download both some example data (relatively small) and the model weights (22 GB).
The latter can be particularly slow depending on network bandwidth.
For reference, it takes around 2.5 minutes on a 100 MB/s wired connection.

```bash
python src/alpamayo_r1/test_inference.py
```

In case you would like to obtain more trajectories and reasoning traces, please feel free to change
the `num_traj_samples=1` argument to a higher number (Line 60).

### Interactive notebook

We provide a notebook with similar inference code at `notebook/inference.ipynb`.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<details>
<summary><strong>Does the 10B model accept navigation/route inputs?</strong></summary>

While we have experimented with route conditioning capabilities, the released model does **not** include this feature. The current release takes multi-camera video and egomotion history as inputs, without explicit navigation or route inputs (e.g., waypoints, turn-by-turn navigation instructions).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does the model produce meta-actions or support general VQA?</strong></summary>

While we have experimented with meta-action and general VQA capabilities, the released model does **not** include these features. Alpamayo 1 is designed specifically for trajectory prediction with Chain-of-Causation reasoning, producing trajectory + reasoning trace outputs.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Was the 10B model post-trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL)?</strong></summary>

No. The current 10B model release has **not** undergone RL post-training. While the paper describes RL stages for improving reasoning quality and action consistency, this release focuses on the supervised learning components. As mentioned above, we may release RL post-trained models in future releases.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What are the minimum GPU requirements?</strong></summary>

You need an NVIDIA GPU with at least **24 GB VRAM** for inference. Tested configurations include RTX 3090, A100, and H100. Running on GPUs with less memory (e.g., 16 GB) will likely result in CUDA out-of-memory errors.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use this model in production / commercial applications?</strong></summary>

Yes. See the [License](#license) section and the [HuggingFace Model Card](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Alpamayo-R1-10B) for details.

## Troubleshooting

### Flash Attention issues

The model uses Flash Attention 2 by default. If you encounter compatibility issues:

```python
# Use PyTorch's scaled dot-product attention instead
config.attn_implementation = "sdpa"
```

### CUDA out-of-memory errors

If you encounter OOM errors:

1. Ensure you have a GPU with at least 24 GB VRAM
2. Reduce `num_traj_samples` if generating multiple trajectories
3. Close other GPU-intensive applications

## Disclaimer

Alpamayo 1 is a pre-trained reasoning model designed to accelerate research and development in the autonomous vehicle (AV) domain. It is intended to serve as a foundation for a range of AV-related use cases-from instantiating an end-to-end backbone for autonomous driving to enabling reasoning-based auto-labeling tools. In short, it should be viewed as a building block for developing customized AV applications.

Important notes:

- Alpamayo 1 is provided solely for research, experimentation, and evaluation purposes.
- Alpamayo 1 is not a fully fledged driving stack. Among other limitations, it lacks access to critical real-world sensor inputs, does not incorporate required diverse and redundant safety mechanisms, and has not undergone automotive-grade validation for deployment.

By using this model, you acknowledge that it is a research tool intended to support scientific inquiry, benchmarking, and exploration—not a substitute for a certified AV stack. The developers and contributors disclaim any responsibility or liability for the use of the model or its outputs.
