**A 10 million document corpus takes 31 GB of RAM as float32. turbovec fits it in 4 GB - and searches it faster than FAISS.**

turbovec is a Rust vector index with Python bindings, built on Google Research's [**TurboQuant**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19874) algorithm — a data-oblivious quantizer with near-optimal distortion and no separate training phase.

- **Online ingest.** Add vectors, they're indexed — no train step, no parameter tuning, no rebuilds as the corpus grows.
- **Fast SIMD search.** Hand-written kernels — NEON SDOT/SMMLA on ARM, AVX-512 VNNI and `vpermb` on x86, with AVX2 and scalar fallbacks — beat FAISS IndexPQFastScan in every measured config, averaging 3.4× at 4-bit and 23% at 2-bit across the eight cells of each width, on both architectures.
- **Incremental saves.** `sync(path)` persists just what changed since the last sync — one fsync per call, crash-safe at any byte, and a removal or a small append costs milliseconds however large the index. `write`/`load` stay for whole-file snapshots.
- **Filter at search time.** Pass an id allowlist (or a slot bitmask) to `search()` and the kernel honours it directly. You always get up to `k` results from the allowed set — no over-fetching, no recall hit on selective filters.
- **Pure local.** No managed service, no data leaving your machine or VPC. Pair with any open-source embedding model for a fully air-gapped RAG stack.

Building RAG where privacy, memory, or latency matters? **You're in the right place.**

## Python

```bash
pip install turbovec
```

```python
from turbovec import TurboQuantIndex

index = TurboQuantIndex(dim=1536, bit_width=4)
index.add(vectors)
index.add(more_vectors)

scores, indices = index.search(query, k=10)

index.write("my_index.tv")
loaded = TurboQuantIndex.load("my_index.tv")

index.sync("my_index.tv")   # after more changes: durable incremental save
```

`vectors` and `query` are 2-D `float32` arrays of shape `(n, dim)` — other dtypes are rejected rather than silently converted, so cast with `np.asarray(x, dtype=np.float32)` first if needed.

Need stable ids that survive deletes? Use `IdMapIndex`:

```python
import numpy as np
from turbovec import IdMapIndex

index = IdMapIndex(dim=1536, bit_width=4)
index.add_with_ids(vectors, np.array([1001, 1002, 1003], dtype=np.uint64))

scores, ids = index.search(query, k=10)   # ids are your uint64 external ids
index.remove(1002)                         # O(1) by id

index.write("my_index.tvim")
loaded = IdMapIndex.load("my_index.tvim")

index.sync("my_index.tvim")   # durable incremental save, ids included
```

### Hybrid retrieval (filtered search)

Restrict results to a candidate set produced by another system (SQL, BM25, ACL, time window, …):

```python
import numpy as np
from turbovec import IdMapIndex

idx = IdMapIndex(dim=1536, bit_width=4)
idx.add_with_ids(vectors, ids)

# Stage 1: external system narrows to candidate ids.
allowed = np.array(db.execute("SELECT id FROM docs WHERE tenant=?", (t,)).fetchall(),
                   dtype=np.uint64)

# Stage 2: dense rerank within the candidate set.
scores, ids = idx.search(query, k=10, allowlist=allowed)
```

Filtering happens inside the SIMD kernel at 32-vector block granularity: blocks with no allowed slots are short-circuited before any LUT lookup or scoring work, and individual non-allowed slots inside scored blocks are dropped at heap-insert. Selective allowlists (small fraction of the index allowed) therefore avoid most of the SIMD cost rather than paying it and discarding the result afterwards.

The output length is `min(k, n_allowed)`, where `n_allowed` counts *distinct* allowed vectors — when fewer vectors are allowed than `k` you get exactly that many results rather than padded fallbacks.

use turbovec::IdMapIndex;

let mut index = IdMapIndex::new(1536, 4).unwrap();
index.add_with_ids(&vectors, &[1001, 1002, 1003]).unwrap();
let (scores, ids) = index.search(&queries, 10);
index.remove(1002);
index.write("index.tvim").unwrap();
let loaded = IdMapIndex::load("index.tvim").unwrap();
```

## Recall

TurboQuant vs FAISS `IndexPQ` (LUT256, nbits=8) — the paper's Section 4.4 baseline. 100K vectors, k=64. FAISS PQ sub-quantizer counts sized to match TurboQuant's bit rate (m=d/4 at 2-bit, m=d/2 at 4-bit).

![Recall GloVe d=200](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanCodrai/turbovec/main/docs/recall_glove.svg)

![Recall d=1536](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanCodrai/turbovec/main/docs/recall_d1536.svg)

![Recall d=3072](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanCodrai/turbovec/main/docs/recall_d3072.svg)

The charts plot calibrated TurboQuant (TQ+). Across OpenAI d=1536 and d=3072, TQ+ beats FAISS at R@1 on three of four cells (by 0.9–2.9 points; d=1536 4-bit trails by 0.7), and both reach 1.0 by k=8 (≥0.997 already at k≤4). GloVe d=200 is the harder regime — at low dim the asymptotic Beta assumption is looser. TQ+ lands ahead of FAISS at R@1 at both bit widths (+1.9 at 4-bit, +0.8 at 2-bit), with FAISS keeping a slim edge at 2-bit from k≈8. Uncalibrated numbers are in the JSONs (`tq_recalls`).

**A note on baselines.** We compare against FAISS `IndexPQ` (LUT256, nbits=8, float32 LUT) because it's the default production-grade PQ most users would reach for. This is a stronger baseline than the custom u8-LUT PQ in the [TurboQuant paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19874) — FAISS uses a higher-precision LUT at scoring time and k-means++ for codebook training. We reproduce the paper's TurboQuant numbers on OpenAI d=1536 / d=3072 and hit similar numbers to other community reference implementations on low-dim embeddings (see [`turboquant-py`](https://pypi.org/project/turboquant-py/) at d=384). On GloVe (d=200) — the low-dim regime where the asymptotic Beta assumption is loosest — TurboQuant lands ahead of FAISS at 4-bit but trails it at 2-bit; TQ+ calibration recovers the 2-bit deficit at R@1 (0.572 vs FAISS's 0.564), with FAISS keeping a slim edge at deeper k.

Full results: [d=1536 2-bit](https://github.com/RyanCodrai/turbovec/blob/main/benchmarks/results/recall_d1536_2bit.json), [d=1536 4-bit](https://github.com/RyanCodrai/turbovec/blob/main/benchmarks/results/recall_d1536_4bit.json), [d=3072 2-bit](https://github.com/RyanCodrai/turbovec/blob/main/benchmarks/results/recall_d3072_2bit.json), [d=3072 4-bit](https://github.com/RyanCodrai/turbovec/blob/main/benchmarks/results/recall_d3072_4bit.json), [GloVe 2-bit](https://github.com/RyanCodrai/turbovec/blob/main/benchmarks/results/recall_glove_2bit.json), [GloVe 4-bit](https://github.com/RyanCodrai/turbovec/blob/main/benchmarks/results/recall_glove_4bit.json).

## Compression

![Compression](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanCodrai/turbovec/main/docs/compression.svg)

## Search Speed

All benchmarks: 100K vectors, 1K queries, k=64, median of 5 runs.

### ARM (GCP c4a-standard-8, Google Axion, 8 vCPUs)

![ARM Speed — Single-threaded](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanCodrai/turbovec/main/docs/arm_speed_st.svg)

![ARM Speed — Multi-threaded](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanCodrai/turbovec/main/docs/arm_speed_mt.svg)

On ARM, TurboQuant beats FAISS FastScan in every config, averaging 3.5× at 4-bit (3.4–3.7× across cells — the SDOT/SMMLA dot-product kernels score the vector-major layout directly) and 26% at 2-bit (22–29%).

### x86 (Intel Xeon Platinum 8481C / Sapphire Rapids, 8 vCPUs)

![x86 Speed — Single-threaded](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanCodrai/turbovec/main/docs/x86_speed_st.svg)

![x86 Speed — Multi-threaded](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanCodrai/turbovec/main/docs/x86_speed_mt.svg)

On x86, TurboQuant wins every config, averaging 3.4× at 4-bit (3.2–3.5× across cells — the AVX-512 VNNI dot-product kernel on the vector-major layout) and 20% at 2-bit (5–32%), where the `vpermb` LUT scan carries the short 2-bit accumulate loop.

## Insertion & Removal Latency

Same corpus as the search cells: 100K OpenAI vectors, median of 5 runs, timed loops including the Python-call overhead a caller actually pays per op. Insertion measures per-vector `add()` latency on a warm, populated index (built untimed) at n=1 — a single-vector `add()` — and n=100 — a 100-vector batch, showing how far batching amortizes the per-call overhead — against `add()` into the trained, populated FAISS `IndexPQFastScan` (training untimed). A single `add()` lands in 6.3–19.7 µs depending on the cell (7.6–13.9× faster than a FAISS single add), and a 100-vector batch amortizes TurboQuant to 4.6–16.3 µs/vector (4.6–15.1× faster than the same batch into FAISS). Removal measures per-op remove-by-id latency at n=1 (the steady per-op rate over 1000 removes) and n=100 (the first 100 removes on a fresh index): `IdMapIndex.remove(id)` — O(1) swap-and-pop plus the id-map bookkeeping — lands at 0.44–1.22 µs and 0.59–1.37 µs per op across the cells. The FAISS column is the same user-visible operation, `remove_ids` on an `IndexIDMap` over `IndexPQFastScan`, which repacks the stored codes on every call: 0.19–1.02 s per single remove at 100K, with cost doubling alongside code size — which is why the removal charts use a log-scale axis. Charts show the single-threaded cells (`RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1`); the `_mt` cells are measured too and match at n=1, since a single add is serial.

## Save & Load

Same corpus as the search cells: 100K OpenAI vectors, median of 5 runs. TurboQuant serializes to a single `.tv` file with an fsync + atomic rename; FAISS is `write_index` / `read_index` on the precision-matched `IndexPQFastScan` (sub-quantizer count matched to TurboQuant's bit rate, as in the search cells). **Save (warm)** is a write after a search has run, so the blocked layout cache is populated. **Load → first search** opens a fresh index and times the first query — separating bare deserialization (the page cache is warm throughout, so this is layout work, not cold-storage I/O) from the first-query cost. **Round-trip** chains the checkpoint/resume cycle an embedding store actually pays — mutate 1K vectors → save → reopen → serve the first query; FAISS has no measured equivalent for this path, so it is shown for TurboQuant only. On the smaller payloads the round-trip can come in *below* the isolated post-mutation ("dirty") write: the two are timed in separate suite steps, and at small file sizes the standalone `fsync` in the dirty-write step dominates and inflates it — a measurement artifact of the harness, not a repack win in the combined path. Single-threaded cells pin `RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1`. Scripts: [`benchmarks/suite/`](https://github.com/RyanCodrai/turbovec/tree/main/benchmarks/suite/).

## How it works

Each vector is a direction on a high-dimensional hypersphere. TurboQuant compresses these directions using a simple insight: after applying a random rotation, every coordinate follows a known distribution -- regardless of the input data.

**1. Normalize.** Strip the length (norm) from each vector and store it as a single float. Now every vector is a unit direction on the hypersphere.

**2. Random rotation.** Multiply all vectors by the same random orthogonal matrix. After rotation, each coordinate independently follows a Beta distribution that converges to Gaussian N(0, 1/d) in high dimensions. This holds for any input data -- the rotation makes the coordinate distribution predictable.

**3. Per-coordinate calibration (TQ+).** The Beta distribution from step 2 is asymptotic — at finite dimensions, individual coordinates drift from the canonical shape (especially low-bit and word-vector-style embeddings). TQ+ fits two scalars per coordinate — a shift and a scale — mapping each coordinate's empirical quantiles onto the codebook's outermost centroids. The probability level comes from the codebook, so it tracks the bit width (~0.933 at 2-bit, ~0.996 at 4-bit) rather than being fixed. The Lloyd-Max codebook then quantizes against the *target* distribution it was designed for. The fit is explicit: call `index.calibrate(sample)` once with a random, representative sample of your vectors (~1024 rows is enough — a draw of that size matches fitting on the whole corpus) before adding; afterwards the calibration is committed and reused by every add — no retraining, no rebuilds, no separate train phase. An index you never calibrate is plain TurboQuant. `index.calibration_state` reports `"uncalibrated"` or `"calibrated"`. Recall gain: up to +2.2pp at @1 on the cells that drift most (e.g. GloVe at 2-bit).

**4. Lloyd-Max scalar quantization.** Since the distribution is known, we can precompute the optimal way to bucket each coordinate. For 2-bit, that's 4 buckets; for 4-bit, 16 buckets. The [Lloyd-Max algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd%27s_algorithm) finds bucket boundaries and centroids that minimize mean squared error. These are computed once from the math, not from the data.

**5. Bit-pack.** Each coordinate is now a small integer (0-3 for 2-bit, 0-15 for 4-bit). Pack these tightly into bytes. A 1536-dim vector goes from 6,144 bytes (FP32) to 384 bytes (2-bit). That's 16x compression.

**6. Length-renormalized scoring.** Scalar quantization systematically underestimates inner products — the reconstructed unit direction is a little shorter than the original. We compute one scalar per vector at encode time — the inner product of the rotated unit vector with its own centroid reconstruction — and store `||v|| / ⟨u, x̂⟩` alongside each compressed vector. The search kernel multiplies the per-candidate score by this scalar before heap insertion, turning the inner-product estimator from downward-biased into unbiased at zero search-time cost and zero extra storage. The recall gain shows up most at low bit widths, where the quantization shrinkage is largest.

Encoding cost: one extra `d`-dimensional dot product per vector to compute `⟨u, x̂⟩`. On 1M vectors at d=1536 this is sub-second of additional encode time — a one-shot price paid at ingest, not at query.

**Search.** Instead of decompressing every database vector, we rotate the query once into the same domain and score directly against the codebook values. The scoring kernel uses SIMD intrinsics (NEON on ARM; AVX-512BW on modern x86, falling back to AVX2, then to a scalar path on pre-AVX2 CPUs) with nibble-split lookup tables for maximum throughput.

The Lloyd-Max codebook achieves distortion within a factor of 2.7x of the information-theoretic lower bound (Shannon's distortion-rate limit); the length-renormalization step removes the residual bias the Lloyd-Max codebook introduces on the inner-product estimator itself.

## Building

### Python (via maturin)

```bash
pip install maturin
cd turbovec-python
maturin build --release
pip install target/wheels/*.whl
```

### Rust

```bash
cargo build --release
```

All x86_64 builds target `x86-64-v2` (SSE4.2 baseline, Nehalem 2008+) via `.cargo/config.toml`, so any x86-64-v2 CPU can run the whole crate. The AVX-512 and AVX2 kernels are `#[target_feature]`-gated and selected at runtime via `is_x86_feature_detected!`, so they kick in on hardware that supports them regardless of the compile baseline; CPUs with neither run the scalar fallback.

## Running benchmarks

Download datasets:
```bash
python3 benchmarks/download_data.py all            # all datasets
python3 benchmarks/download_data.py glove          # GloVe d=200
python3 benchmarks/download_data.py openai-1536    # OpenAI DBpedia d=1536
python3 benchmarks/download_data.py openai-3072    # OpenAI DBpedia d=3072
```

Each benchmark is a self-contained script in `benchmarks/suite/`. Run any one individually:
```bash
python3 benchmarks/suite/speed_d1536_2bit_arm_mt.py
python3 benchmarks/suite/recall_d1536_2bit.py
python3 benchmarks/suite/compression.py
```

Run all benchmarks for a category:
```bash
for f in benchmarks/suite/speed_*arm*.py; do python3 "$f"; done    # all ARM speed
for f in benchmarks/suite/speed_*x86*.py; do python3 "$f"; done    # all x86 speed
for f in benchmarks/suite/recall_*.py; do python3 "$f"; done       # all recall
python3 benchmarks/suite/compression.py                            # compression
```

Results are saved as JSON to `benchmarks/results/`. Regenerate charts:
```bash
python3 benchmarks/create_diagrams.py
```

### Quick harness for optimization work

The suite above is the source of every published number — real embeddings,
FAISS comparator, fixed shapes, run on the two official environments. For the
inner loop of an optimization pass there's also a Rust harness that reproduces
the four mutation metrics (cold bulk add, warm append, single add, remove) on
deterministic synthetic vectors, so a hypothesis can be measured in seconds on
any machine with no dataset and no FAISS:

```bash
cargo run --release --example insert_bench -- --dim 1536 --bits 2
RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1 cargo run --release --example insert_bench
```

It is a screening tool, not a source of published numbers.

`examples/encode_hash` prints a per-stage hash of the encode pipeline for a
fixed input; CI runs it on every OS in the matrix and fails if they disagree,
which is how cross-platform byte identity of the encode is checked.
