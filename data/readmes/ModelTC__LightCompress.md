> **📢 Notice**: This repository was formerly known as **LLMC** and has been renamed to **LightCompress**.

**LightCompress** is an off-the-shell tool designed for compressing aigc models(LLM, VLM, Diffusion ...), leveraging state-of-the-art compression algorithms to enhance efficiency and reduce model size without compromising performance. You can download the Docker image that can run LightCompress with the following command. Users in mainland China are recommended to use Alibaba Cloud Docker.

```shell
# docker hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/llmcompression/llmc
docker pull llmcompression/llmc:pure-latest

# aliyun docker: registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/yongyang/llmcompression:[tag]
docker pull registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/yongyang/llmcompression:pure-latest
```

  We modularly and fairly benchmark the quantization techniques considering calibration cost, inference efficiency, and quantized accuracy. Near 600 experiments on diverse models and datasets provide three insightful takeaways
  on the calibration data, algorithm pipeline, and quantization configuration selection. Based on the takeaways, a best practice for the LLM PTQ pipeline is designed, to achieve the best accuracy and efficiency performance balance
  under various scenarios.

- **Mar 07, 2024:** 🚀 We release the quantization part of a powerful and efficient LLM compression tool. Notably, our benchmark paper is coming soon😊.
