### 🛠 Tools

gptme equips the AI with a rich set of built-in tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `shell` | Execute shell commands directly in your terminal |
| `ipython` | Run Python code with access to your installed libraries |
| `read` | Read files and directories |
| `save` / `append` | Create or update files |
| `patch` / `morph` | Make incremental edits to existing files |
| `browser` | Search and navigate the web via Playwright |
| `vision` | Process and analyze images |
| `screenshot` | Capture screenshots of your desktop |
| `rag` | Retrieve context from local files (Retrieval Augmented Generation) |
| `gh` | Interact with GitHub via the GitHub CLI |
| `tmux` | Run long-lived commands in persistent terminal sessions |
| `computer` | Full desktop access for GUI interactions |
| `subagent` | Spawn sub-agents for parallel or isolated tasks |
| `chats` | Reference and search past conversations |

Use `/tools` during a conversation to see all available tools and their status.

### 🔌 Extensibility: Plugins, Skills & Lessons

gptme has a layered extensibility system that lets you tailor it to your workflow:

**[Plugins][docs-plugins]** — extend gptme with custom tools, hooks, and commands via Python packages:

```toml
# gptme.toml
[plugins]
paths = ["~/.config/gptme/plugins", "./plugins"]
enabled = ["my_plugin"]
```

**[Skills][docs-skills]** — lightweight workflow bundles (Anthropic format) that auto-load when mentioned by name. Great for packaging reusable instructions and helper scripts without writing Python.

**[Lessons][docs-lessons]** — contextual guidance that auto-injects into conversations based on keywords, tools, and patterns. Write your own to capture team best-practices or domain knowledge.

**[Hooks][docs-hooks]** — run custom code at key lifecycle events (before/after tool calls, on conversation start, etc.) without a full plugin.

**[gptme-contrib][gptme-contrib]** — community-contributed plugins, packages, scripts, and lessons:

| Plugin / Package | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [gptme-codegraph](https://github.com/gptme/gptme-contrib/tree/master/packages/gptme-codegraph) | Structural code retrieval with tree-sitter: 9 MCP tools for parse, call graph, blast/impact analysis |
| [gptme-consortium](https://github.com/gptme/gptme-contrib/tree/master/plugins/gptme-consortium) | Multi-model consensus decision-making |
| [gptme-imagen](https://github.com/gptme/gptme-contrib/tree/master/plugins/gptme-imagen) | Multi-provider image generation |
| [gptme-lsp](https://github.com/gptme/gptme-contrib/tree/master/plugins/gptme-lsp) | Language Server Protocol integration |
| [gptme-ace](https://github.com/gptme/gptme-contrib/tree/master/plugins/gptme-ace) | ACE-inspired context optimization |
| [gptme-gupp](https://github.com/gptme/gptme-contrib/tree/master/plugins/gptme-gupp) | Work state persistence across sessions |

### 🔗 Integrations: MCP & ACP

**[MCP (Model Context Protocol)][docs-mcp]** — use any MCP server as a tool source:

```sh
pipx install gptme  # MCP support included by default
```

gptme can discover and dynamically load MCP servers, giving the agent access to databases, APIs, file systems, and any other MCP-compatible tool. See the [MCP docs][docs-mcp] for server configuration.

**[ACP (Agent Client Protocol)][docs-acp]** — use gptme as a coding agent directly from your editor:

```sh
pipx install 'gptme[acp]'
```

This makes gptme available as a drop-in coding agent in [Zed](https://zed.dev/) and JetBrains IDEs. Your editor sends requests, gptme executes with its full toolset (shell, browser, files, etc.) and streams results back.

### 🤖 Autonomous Agents

gptme is designed to run not just interactively but as a **persistent autonomous agent** — an AI that runs continuously, remembers everything, and gets better over time. The [gptme-agent-template][agent-template] provides a complete scaffold:

- **Persistent workspace** — git-tracked "brain" with journal, tasks, knowledge base, and lessons
- **Run loops** — scheduled (systemd/launchd) or event-driven autonomous operation
- **Task management** — structured task queue with YAML metadata and GTD-style workflows
- **Meta-learning** — lessons system captures behavioral patterns and improves over time
- **Multi-agent coordination** — file leases, message bus, and work claiming for concurrent agents
- **External integrations** — GitHub, email, Discord, Twitter, RSS, and more

```sh
# Create and run your own agent
gptme-agent create ~/my-agent --name MyAgent
gptme-agent install   # runs on a schedule
gptme-agent status    # check on it
```

[**Bob**](https://github.com/TimeToBuildBob) is the reference implementation — a production autonomous agent that's been running continuously since late 2024. Bob opens PRs, reviews code, fixes CI, manages his own task queue, maintains a growing set of behavioral lessons, posts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TimeToBuildBob), responds on Discord, and writes [blog posts](https://timetobuildbob.github.io/).

Multiple specialized agents can run in parallel — e.g. Bob (engineering) and [Alice](https://github.com/TimeToLearnAlice) (personal assistant & orchestration) — coordinating through shared infrastructure.

See the [Autonomous Agents docs](https://gptme.org/docs/agents.html) for the full guide.

### 🛡 Guardrails

Persistent agents need guardrails around the full loop, not just tool permissions:

- **Input guardrails** — structured task selectors in the agent workspace keep work focused and reduce thrashing on notifications or ambiguous work. Bob uses a CASCADE-style selector for this layer.
- **Pre-action guardrails** — [lessons][docs-lessons] inject situational guidance before the agent acts.
- **Output guardrails** — [hooks][docs-hooks] and [pre-commit checks](https://gptme.org/docs/usage.html#pre-commit-integration) validate file changes before control returns to the user.

This stack is simple and composable: selectors improve work choice, lessons steer behavior, and checks verify the result. You can add evals on top later, but the baseline guardrail loop already exists.

### 🛠 Use Cases

- 🖥 **Development:** Write and run code faster with AI assistance.
- 🎯 **Shell Expert:** Get the right command using natural language (no more memorizing flags!).
- 📊 **Data Analysis:** Process and analyze data directly in your terminal.
- 🎓 **Interactive Learning:** Experiment with new technologies or codebases hands-on.
- 🤖 **Agents & Tools:** Build long-running autonomous agents for real work.
- 🔬 **Research:** Automate literature review, data collection, and analysis pipelines.

### 🛠 Developer Perks

- ⭐ One of the first agent CLIs created (Spring 2023) that is still in active development.
- 🧰 **Easy to extend**
  - Most functionality can be implemented with [tools][docs-tools], [hooks][docs-hooks], and [commands][docs-commands].
  - [Plugins][docs-plugins] allow for easy packaging of extensions.
  - Trying to stay [tiny][docs-arewetiny] — minimal core, extend as needed.
- 🧪 Extensive testing, high coverage.
- 🧹 Clean codebase, checked and formatted with `mypy`, `ruff`, and `pyupgrade`.
- 🤖 [GitHub Bot][docs-bot] to request changes from comments! (see [#16](https://github.com/gptme/gptme/issues/16))
  - Operates in this repo! (see [#18](https://github.com/gptme/gptme/issues/18) for example)
  - Runs entirely in GitHub Actions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or newer
- Credentials for at least one LLM provider:
  - OpenRouter can be configured interactively with `/account setup openrouter`
    inside gptme, using browser OAuth onboarding.
  - Subscriptions work too: sign in with your ChatGPT Plus/Pro or SuperGrok plan
    via `gptme-auth openai-subscription` or `gptme-auth grok-subscription`,
    no API key needed (see [providers docs][docs-providers]).
  - You can also set API keys manually for [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/)
    (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`), [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/)
    (`OPENAI_API_KEY`), [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)
    (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`), and other providers.
  - Local models via `llama.cpp` need no key — see [providers docs][docs-providers].

                         sonnet-4-20250514. If only provider given then a
                         default is used.
  -w, --workspace TEXT   Path to workspace directory. Pass '@log' to create a
                         workspace in the log directory.
  --agent-path TEXT      Path to agent workspace directory.
  -r, --resume           Load most recent conversation.
  -y, --no-confirm       Skip all confirmation prompts.
  -n, --non-interactive  Non-interactive mode. Implies --no-confirm.
  --output-format [text|json]
                         Output format for non-interactive mode. 'json'
                         emits one JSON object per line on stdout.
  --system TEXT          System prompt. Options: 'full', 'short', or something
                         custom.
  -t, --tools TEXT       Tools to allow as comma-separated list. Available:
                         append, browser, chats, choice, computer, gh,
                         ipython, morph, patch, rag, read, save, screenshot,
                         shell, subagent, tmux, vision.
  --tool-format TEXT     Tool format to use. Options: markdown, xml, tool
  --no-stream            Don't stream responses
  --show-hidden          Show hidden system messages.
  -v, --verbose          Show verbose output.
  --version              Show version and configuration information
  --help                 Show this message and exit.
```

Pair ``--non-interactive`` with ``--output-format json`` when stdout needs to
be machine-readable, for example in CI or a supervising process. Use
``--resume`` to continue an existing automated conversation or pick up queued
follow-up prompts without passing a new prompt.
