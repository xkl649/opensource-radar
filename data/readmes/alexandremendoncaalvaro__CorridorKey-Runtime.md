# CorridorKey-Runtime

![CorridorKey OFX Plugin](./assets/ofx_example.gif)

Native AI keying runtime and OFX plugin for **DaVinci Resolve and Foundry Nuke**, built in collaboration with **Corridor Digital**.

CorridorKey-Runtime provides three product surfaces:

- **OFX plugin** for interactive keying inside DaVinci Resolve and Foundry Nuke
- **CLI** (`corridorkey`) for local processing, diagnostics, and automation
- **GUI** (Tauri-based desktop app) for users who prefer a graphical workflow over the CLI

The Windows suite installer installs the CLI/runtime core as the fixed base. The OFX plugin, Adobe plugins, GUI, Green model pack, and Blue model/runtime pack are optional suite components. Standalone OFX support packages may still place `corridorkey.exe` next to `CorridorKey.ofx`, but the CLI no longer depends on installing an OFX host surface. The GUI is distributed either as an optional suite component that points at the shared runtime root or as a portable Runtime bundle that carries the GUI and local runtime package together.

Adobe After Effects and Premiere plugins are packaged implementation targets,
but they are not supported public surfaces until host validation passes.

Current public builds support:

- **Windows (NVIDIA RTX)**
- **macOS (Apple Silicon)**

## What this project focuses on

- Native local execution
- Practical deployment in real editing workflows
- Support for **NVIDIA RTX** and **Apple Silicon**
- Stable surfaces for **DaVinci Resolve and Foundry Nuke users**, **CLI/integration workflows**, and **desktop GUI operators**

## Supported Surfaces

### OFX plugin for DaVinci Resolve and Foundry Nuke

Use CorridorKey directly inside DaVinci Resolve or Foundry Nuke through the OFX plugin. The plugin is host-agnostic and registers itself at the standard OpenFX bundle path, so any OFX 1.4-compliant host that scans that path picks it up.

### CLI (`corridorkey`)

The Windows suite installs the `corridorkey` CLI as part of the fixed runtime/CLI core and registers its directory on `PATH`. The portable Runtime bundle also carries the CLI for minimal or support installs. Use it for:

- environment diagnostics
- scripted processing
- machine-readable JSON output
- automation and integration workflows

### GUI (Tauri desktop app)

A Tauri-based desktop application is available for users who prefer a graphical workflow over the CLI. It can be installed from the suite installer or launched from the portable Runtime bundle, so it does not require the OFX bundle to be installed.

## Installation

Pre-packaged releases are available on the
[Releases](https://github.com/alexandremendoncaalvaro/CorridorKey-Runtime/releases)
page. Download the package that matches your platform and product track.

For supported hardware configurations and explicit support status per platform,
see [Support Matrix](./help/SUPPORT_MATRIX.md).

### OFX Plugin - macOS (Apple Silicon)

1. Download the `.pkg` Apple Silicon installer.
2. Run the installer with DaVinci Resolve closed.
3. Open DaVinci Resolve 20, go to the Color or Fusion page, and search for
   "CorridorKey" in the OpenFX Library.
4. Drag the node onto your clip. The plugin uses the MLX-accelerated path
   automatically on M-series chips.

### OFX Plugin - Windows

1. Download the `.exe` installer for your hardware path:
   - **Windows RTX** - official Windows RTX installer for NVIDIA RTX 30 series
     and newer. This track ships the public FP16 quality ladder:
     **Draft (512)**, **High (1024)**, **Ultra (1536)**, and
     **Maximum (2048)**. `Auto` respects the safe VRAM ceiling for the active
     GPU tier, while manual fixed quality may attempt a higher packaged rung
     with explicit runtime fallback if it fails.
   - **DirectML package** - experimental Windows track for DirectX 12 GPUs
     outside the official RTX path. This track is not broadly validated across
     AMD, Intel, or RTX 20 series hardware and should only appear in releases
     when it is published intentionally.
2. Run the installer as Administrator with DaVinci Resolve closed.
3. Open DaVinci Resolve 20, go to the Color or Fusion page, and search for
   "CorridorKey" in the OpenFX Library.
4. Drag the node onto your clip. TensorRT RTX compilation on the first frame
   may take 10-30 seconds.

For plugin discovery issues, version mismatches, or unsupported hardware
behavior, see [Troubleshooting](./help/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

### CLI

Download the portable runtime release for your platform.

- On macOS bundles and source builds, use `corridorkey`
- In the Windows portable runtime bundle, use `ck-engine.exe`

## CLI Usage

The examples below use the macOS and source-build command name `corridorkey`.
In the Windows portable runtime bundle, replace it with `ck-engine.exe`.

**Check hardware capability:**

```bash
corridorkey doctor
````

**Process a video with hardware-aware defaults:**

```bash
corridorkey process input.mp4 output.mp4
```

**Process with a specific preset:**

```bash
corridorkey process input.mp4 output.mp4 --preset max
```

**Process with an external Alpha Hint:**

```bash
corridorkey process input.mp4 output.mp4 --alpha-hint hint.mp4
```

Append `--json` to any command to receive NDJSON event streams for pipeline
integration.

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

* C++20 compiler: Visual Studio 2022 (v17.4+), Apple Clang 15+, or GCC 12+
* CMake 3.28+
* Ninja
* vcpkg with `VCPKG_ROOT` set

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexandremendoncaalvaro/CorridorKey-Runtime.git
cd CorridorKey-Runtime
export VCPKG_ROOT="$HOME/vcpkg"
cmake --preset release
cmake --build --preset release
```

On Windows, use `.\scripts\windows.ps1 -Task build -Preset release` for local
builds. Use `.\scripts\windows.ps1 -Task package-runtime -Preset release
-FfmpegPath C:\path\to\ffmpeg.exe` for the portable Runtime/GUI ZIP, or set
`CORRIDORKEY_FFMPEG_PATH` before running the command. Use
`.\scripts\windows.ps1 -Task package-suite` for the top-level online suite
installer once the runtime, OFX, and Adobe payload roots have been staged. The
suite installer keeps the CLI/runtime core fixed and lets the user select GUI,
host plugins, Green, and Blue components. Use
`.\scripts\windows.ps1 -Task release -Version X.Y.Z -Flavor online` for the
current automated release track packaging.

Lower-level Windows scripts exist only as internal delegates for debugging the
wrapper itself. If you invoke CMake directly, activate the MSVC developer
environment first. Windows distribution artifacts include
`model_inventory.json` and `bundle_validation.json` when packaging succeeds
with a partial model set, so missing packaged models are explicit and do not
silently change runtime behavior.

For local Windows workflow, the canonical wrapper exposes three different
levels of operation:

* `.\scripts\windows.ps1 -Task build -Preset release`

  * build only
* `.\scripts\windows.ps1 -Task package-ofx -Version X.Y.Z -Track rtx`

  * package the `Windows RTX` installer from an already certified Windows RTX
    model set
* `.\scripts\windows.ps1 -Task certify-rtx-artifacts -Version X.Y.Z`

  * certify an already existing Windows RTX model set and write the artifact
    manifest without regenerating the `.onnx` files from the checkpoint
* `.\scripts\windows.ps1 -Task regen-rtx-release -Version X.Y.Z`

  * regenerate ONNX artifacts from the checkpoint, certify the RTX ladder,
    write the artifact manifest, and then package the `Windows RTX`
    installer

`package-ofx` for Windows RTX is intentionally strict. It no longer accepts a
raw `models\` folder by itself. The command requires a certified
`artifact_manifest.json` that matches the packaged RTX model and `*_ctx.onnx`
files exactly. If you only have stale or manually copied models, use
`certify-rtx-artifacts` or `regen-rtx-release` first.
