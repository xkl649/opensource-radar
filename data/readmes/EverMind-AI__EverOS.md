## Why Ever OS

EverOS is a Python library and local-first memory runtime for agents and
makers. It gives one portable memory layer across coding assistants, apps,
devices, and workflows from day one. It stores conversations, files, and agent
trajectories as readable Markdown, then syncs local SQLite and LanceDB indexes
for fast retrieval and self-evolving reuse.

## Quick Start

> One OpenRouter API key is enough to start EverOS, write durable memories,
> and retrieve them with keyword search.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- One [OpenRouter API key](https://openrouter.ai/keys)

### 1. Install

```bash
uv pip install everos
# or: pip install everos
```

### 2. Try the standalone demo — no key required

No API key or server setup required—run one command to quickly experience how
EverOS stores and recalls memory:

```bash
# If you installed EverOS as a package:
everos demo

# If you cloned or forked this repository and have not activated .venv:
uv run everos demo
```

Enter something EverOS should remember, then ask a related question to watch
the memory move through ingest -> extract -> index -> recall.

<https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98cb8e1e-2ca8-4504-b0a6-0b9a040a0a5c>

### 3. Initialize and add your OpenRouter key

```bash
everos init
```

This creates `~/.everos/everos.toml` and `~/.everos/ome.toml`. Open
`~/.everos/everos.toml`; the generated model and OpenRouter URL are already
correct, so replace only the empty `api_key`:

```toml
[llm]
model = "openai/gpt-4.1-mini"
api_key = "<OPENROUTER_API_KEY>"
base_url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
```

This is the smallest Tier 1 setup: memory add, flush, Markdown persistence,
cascade indexing, and keyword search.

Use `everos init --root <path>` if you want a different memory root. Pass the
same `--root <path>` to subsequent commands.

### 4. Start EverOS

```bash
everos server start
```

Keep the server running, then open a second terminal and check it:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

Look for `"status":"ok"`. With this one-key setup, `capabilities.llm` is
`true`; embedding and rerank remain `false` until you configure them.

### 5. Add and retrieve your first memory

> [!NOTE]
> Business endpoints live under `/api/v2`. The older `/api/v1` prefix still
> resolves to the same handlers so existing integrations keep working, but it
> is a legacy alias that may be removed in a future major release — write new
> code against `/api/v2`.

Add a tiny conversation:

```bash
TS=$(($(date +%s)*1000))

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v2/memory/add \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{
    \"session_id\": \"demo-001\",
    \"app_id\": \"default\",
    \"project_id\": \"default\",
    \"messages\": [
      {\"sender_id\": \"alice\", \"role\": \"user\", \"timestamp\": $TS, \"content\": \"I love climbing in Yosemite every spring.\"},
      {\"sender_id\": \"alice\", \"role\": \"user\", \"timestamp\": $((TS+10000)), \"content\": \"My favorite coffee shop is Blue Bottle in SOMA.\"}
    ]
  }"
```

Flush the memory at the end of the session:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v2/memory/flush \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"session_id":"demo-001","app_id":"default","project_id":"default"}'
```

Search it back:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v2/memory/search \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "alice",
    "app_id": "default",
    "project_id": "default",
    "query": "Where do I like to climb?",
    "method": "keyword",
    "top_k": 5
  }'
```

You should see the Yosemite memory in the response. Keep
`"method": "keyword"` in this one-key setup because the API defaults to hybrid
search, which requires an embedding provider.

> [!TIP]
> **First memory unlocked.**
> You just gave EverOS a fact, flushed it into durable Markdown-backed memory,
> and searched it back through the local index. That is the core loop.
> Want to see the source of truth? Open `~/.everos` and inspect the generated
> Markdown files.

For annotated responses and the Markdown files EverOS creates, see
[QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md).

### What works with one key?

The OpenRouter one-key setup is EverOS Tier 1. It supports server startup,
memory add and flush, durable Markdown storage, cascade indexing, and keyword
search. Add optional providers only when you need the features below:

| Configuration | Adds |
| --- | --- |
| `[llm]` only | Core memory flow and keyword search |
| Add `[embedding]` | Vector/user hybrid search, reflection, and skill extraction |
| Add `[rerank]` too | Agentic search, default agent hybrid search, and Knowledge Wiki |
| Add `[multimodal]` and parser extra | Image, PDF, audio, and office-file ingestion |

Missing optional capabilities are reported by `/health` and return a clear
HTTP 422 if you request a feature that needs them.

> [!NOTE]
> `everos demo --live` is different from the standalone demo in step 2: it
> connects to a running server and uses the real add/flush/search flow. It uses
> hybrid search, so add an embedding provider before you run it.

### Optional: Ingest Multimodal Files

To ingest non-text content (image / pdf / audio / office documents)
through `/api/v2/memory/add` `content` items, install the optional
extra:

```bash
uv pip install 'everos[multimodal]'   # or: pip install 'everos[multimodal]'
```

This pulls in `everalgo-parser` (with the `[svg]` bundle for SVG support via
cairosvg). Configure the `[multimodal]` section in `everos.toml`; its default
model is `google/gemini-3-flash-preview` via OpenRouter.

**Office document support requires LibreOffice as a system dependency.**
The parser shells out to `soffice` (LibreOffice's headless renderer) to
convert `.doc` / `.docx` / `.ppt` / `.pptx` / `.xls` / `.xlsx` to PDF
before feeding the result into the multimodal LLM. Without LibreOffice,
office uploads return HTTP 415 with a clear error message; PDF / image
/ audio / HTML / email parsing is unaffected.

Install on the host before serving office documents:

```bash
brew install --cask libreoffice              # macOS
sudo apt-get install -y libreoffice          # Debian / Ubuntu
```

### For Contributors

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EverMind-AI/EverOS.git
cd EverOS
uv sync                              # creates ./.venv and installs deps
uv run everos demo --plain           # try the local educational demo; no API keys needed
uv run everos init                   # add one OpenRouter key to ~/.everos/everos.toml

uv run everos --help
make test
```

## Use Cases

Now that you have had your first successful EverOS moment, explore what people
are building with persistent memory across agents, apps, and community
integrations.

Use cases show what persistent memory makes possible in real products and
workflows. Some examples are packaged in this repository; others point to
external demos or integrations you can study and adapt.
