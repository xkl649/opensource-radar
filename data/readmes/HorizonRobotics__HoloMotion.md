# News
- [2026.07.16] HoloMotion v1.4 introduces HoloRetarget at 3,000+ FPS on RTX 4090 for training data generation and 300+ FPS entirely on-robot for teleoperation, plus HoloSMPL for 10+ datasets and devices.
- [2026.05.15] HoloMotion v1.3 scales from 60M to 0.4B parameters and 80 to 2000+ hours of motion data, while improving policy inference from ~100 to ~300 FPS.
- [2026.04.04] HoloMotion v1.2 provides pre-trained motion tracking and velocity tracking models for the community to deploy directly.


# Why HoloMotion?

## Larger, Faster and Stronger

HoloMotion scales humanoid whole-body control through a reference-conditioned MoE Transformer, large-scale motion data, and an optimized training-to-deployment pipeline, delivering stronger motion tracking with real-time inference efficiency.

## Scales Toward 4-Any Humanoid Control

The roadmap of HoloMotion advances through four generalization targets, from motion imitation to command following, terrain adaptation, and embodiment transfer.

| Version  | Target Capability | Status      | Description                                                                                                                         |
| -------- | ----------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **v1** | Any Pose          | ✅ Done        | Achieve robust tracking and imitation of diverse, whole-body human motions, forming the core of the imitation learning capability.  |
| **v2** | Any Command       | 🚀 Next        | Enable language- and task-conditioned motion generation, allowing for goal-directed and interactive behaviors.                      |
| **v3** | Any Embodiment    | 🧭 Planned    | Generalize control policies across humanoids with varying morphologies and kinematics, achieving true embodiment-level abstraction. |
| **v4** | Any Terrain       | 🧭 Planned    | Master adaptation to uneven, dynamic, and complex terrains, enhancing real-world operational robustness.                            |


## Unifies Diverse Motion Sources

HoloSMPL standardizes VR, inertial, optical, and vision capture into a shared representation for HoloRetarget.

</p>

## One Policy Across Modular G1 Configurations

HoloMotion runs one shared motion policy across 2 heads, 5 G1 29-DoF body modes, and 7 hands, covering 66 unique compatible configurations without training a separate policy for every hardware assembly.

The five body modes retain the same 29-DoF kinematic layout while varying pelvis and wrist geometry together with hip, wrist, and waist actuator specifications. The supported modules span Normal and COMP heads; Mode 5, 11, 13, 15, and 18 bodies; and None, Rubber, Dex1-1, Dex3-1, Inspire DFQ, Inspire FTP, and BrainCo Revo2 hand options.

## Closes the Loop From Data to Robots

HoloMotion provides a clear, modular framework for bridging motion data, policy learning, simulation evaluation, and real-robot deployment.

## No Per-User Training Required

Whether you want to replay motions, stream live teleoperation, or train a custom policy, HoloMotion provides a direct path into the workflow:

| User Goal | Start Here | What You Need |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| **Offline motion tracking**<br/>Replay local motion clips for demos such as dance or scripted performances. | [Real-world deployment: Offline Motion](docs/realworld_deployment.md#offline-motion-tracking) | The v1.4.1 Docker image and retargeted `.npz` motion clips. No model training is required. |
| **Online motion tracking**<br/>Follow live VR or teleoperation motion streams. | [Real-world deployment: Teleoperation](docs/realworld_deployment.md#live-teleoperation) | The v1.4.1 Docker image, robot deployment setup, and a live motion source. No model training is required. |
| **Train your own model**<br/>Build a custom policy from your own motion data. | [Environment setup](docs/environment_setup.md) → [HoloSMPL conversion](holosmpl/README.md) → [Retargeting](docs/motion_retargeting.md) → [Training](docs/train_motion_tracking.md) → [Evaluation](docs/evaluate_motion_tracking.md) | Training environment, curated motion data, retargeted HDF5 datasets, and GPU resources. |
