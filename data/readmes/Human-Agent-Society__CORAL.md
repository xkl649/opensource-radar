**CORAL** is infrastructure for **autonomous AI agent organizations** that run experiments, share knowledge, and continuously improve solutions. Give it a codebase and a grader, and CORAL handles the rest: isolated workspaces, safe evaluation, persistent shared state, and multi-agent collaboration. Natively integrated with Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Cursor Agent, and Kiro.

### 🔥 News

- **[2026-07-08]** **CORAL** has been accepted to **COLM 2026**! 🎉
- **[2026-06-24]** The Docker session now isolates the agent from the grader: each agent runs as an unprivileged user (manager and grader stay root), so agents can no longer read `.coral/private/` (grader venv, answer keys) — not even via Bash. On the host this stays opt-in via `agents.isolate_user`.
- **[2026-06-13]** Legacy `eval/grader.py` grader auto-discovery is deprecated and removed — wire graders via `grader.entrypoint` pointing at a packaged grader. See the [custom grader guide](https://coral.compounding-intelligence.ai/docs/guides/custom-grader).
- **[2026-06-06]** CORAL v0.6.0 adds multi-island runs: partition agents into isolated islands with scoped attempts, notes, skills, heartbeat state, and migration between islands for broader exploration.
- **[2026-04-24]** Rubric judges — two reusable LLM-judge grader packages for open-ended tasks (reports, memos, legal analysis). See the [Rubric Judges guide](https://coral.compounding-intelligence.ai/docs/guides/rubric-judge).
- **[2026-04-03]** Our paper, "CORAL: Towards Autonomous Multi-Agent Evolution for Open-Ended Discovery," is now out! Check it out on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.01658v1).
- **[2026-03-18]** CORAL is released! Check out our [blog post](https://coral.compounding-intelligence.ai/blogs/evolve-like-coral/).

### Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Human-Agent-Society/CORAL/main/install.sh | sh
```

Installs the **latest `coral` release** globally via `uv tool install`. Pin a specific release with `CORAL_VERSION=<tag>` if you need to. See [Installation docs](https://coral.compounding-intelligence.ai/docs/getting-started/installation) for manual install, dev setup, and prerequisites.

```bash
coral init my-task                       # scaffold a task
cd my-task && coral start -c task.yaml   # launch agents
```

### Plugin: drive CORAL from your own agent

Prefer to author and run CORAL tasks from inside **your own** Claude Code or Codex without memorizing the CLI? Install the CORAL plugin — a skills-first bundle (no MCP) that teaches the workflows (`coral setup` → `init`/`validate` → `start`/`status`/`log`) and checks `coral` is installed on session start.

**Claude Code:**

```
/plugin marketplace add Human-Agent-Society/CORAL
/plugin install coral@coral-marketplace
```

**Codex** (v0.117.0+):

```
codex plugin marketplace add Human-Agent-Society/CORAL
codex plugin add coral@coral-marketplace
```

Both pull from this repo's marketplace manifests; the plugin lives under [`plugin/`](plugin/).

**Quickstart — point CORAL at code you already have.** Once installed, open the repo whose code you want to optimize and just ask:

```
use coral to optimize this — make sample() in saga/decode.py faster without changing its output
```

The plugin scaffolds a gitignored `.coral_workspace/`, drops your code into a `seed/`, writes a grader for your metric, and loops `coral validate` until the task is launch-ready — then hands you the `coral start` command. On Claude Code a `coral-task-author` subagent does the whole grind autonomously (and a `coral-run-doctor` triages a stuck run); on any harness the bundled skills walk the same path.

Skills: `coral-quickstart` (install → setup → `.coral_workspace/`), `setting-up-coral` (runtime bindings), `creating-a-coral-task` (grader authoring), `running-coral-experiments` (operate a run). See the [Harness Plugin guide](https://coral.compounding-intelligence.ai/docs/guides/plugin) or [`plugin/README.md`](plugin/README.md) for agents, the skills-dir alternative, and other harnesses.

### Supported Agents

| Agent | `agents.runtime` |
|-------|------------------|
| [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) — default | `claude_code` |
| [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) | `codex` |
| [Cursor Agent](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/overview) | `cursor` |
| [Kiro](https://kiro.dev) | `kiro` |
| [OpenCode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode) | `opencode` |

Each agent must be installed and authenticated separately. Per-runtime config — including the [LiteLLM gateway](https://coral.compounding-intelligence.ai/docs/guides/gateway) for custom models — is documented at [Agent Runtimes](https://coral.compounding-intelligence.ai/docs/guides/agent-runtimes).

### How It Works

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/coral_diagram_trans.jpg" alt="CORAL architecture diagram: multiple coding agents run in isolated git worktrees, share state via .coral/public/, and are scored by a grader daemon" width="800">
</p>

Each agent runs in its own git worktree. Shared state (attempts, notes, skills) lives in `.coral/public/` and is symlinked into every worktree — agents see each other's work in real time. A grader daemon scores every commit. The manager interrupts agents with heartbeat prompts (`reflect`, `consolidate`, `pivot`).

### Development

```bash
# Install dev dependencies
uv sync --extra dev

# Run tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Lint & format
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Docker requirement:** Some built-in graders (e.g. SWE-bench, terminal-bench) use [Harbor](https://github.com/corca-ai/harbor) to run evaluations inside Docker containers. CORAL itself must **not** run inside Docker in this case, as Docker-in-Docker (DinD) is not supported. Run CORAL directly on the host machine.

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome — bug reports, new tasks under `examples/`, new agent runtimes, docs, the lot. Start here:

- [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) — dev setup, branch & commit conventions, PR workflow, test/lint commands.
- [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) — rules for AI-assisted contributions (CORAL is itself agent infrastructure, so we expect agent-authored PRs and have a few specific asks).

For a deeper dive into the codebase, the architecture notes in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) cover the eval loop, `.coral/{public,private}/` split, grader daemon, and runtime registry.
