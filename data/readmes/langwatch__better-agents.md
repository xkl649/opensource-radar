Better Agents is a CLI tool and a set of standards for agent building.

It supercharges your coding assistant (Kilocode, Claude Code, Cursor, etc), making it an expert in any agent framework you choose (Agno, Mastra, LangGraph etc) and all their best practices.

It's the best way to start any new agent project.

The Better Agent Structure and generated AGENTS.md ensures industry best practices, making your agent ready for production:
- [Scenario](https://github.com/langwatch/scenario) agent tests written for every feature to ensure agent behaviour
- Versioning of the prompts for collaboration
- Evaluation notebooks for measuring specific prompts performance
- Already instrumented for full observability
- Standardization of structure for better project maintainability

## The Better Agent Structure

```
my-agent-project/
├── app/ (or src/)           # The actual agent code, according to the chosen framework
├── tests/
│   ├── evaluations/         # Jupyter notebooks for evaluations
│   │   └── example_eval.ipynb
│   └── scenarios/           # End-to-end scenario tests
│       └── example_scenario.test.{py,ts}
├── prompts/                 # Versioned prompt files for team collaboration
│   └── sample_prompt.yaml
├── prompts.json             # Prompt registry
├── .mcp.json                # MCP server configuration
├── AGENTS.md                # Development guidelines
├── .env                     # Environment variables
└── .gitignore
```

The structure and guidelines on `AGENTS.md` ensure every new feature required for the coding assistant is properly tested, evaluated, and that the prompts are versioned.

The `.mcp.json` comes with all the right MCPs set up so you coding assistant becomes an expert in your framework of choice and in writing Scenario tests for your agent.

[`scenarios/`](https://github.com/langwatch/scenario) tests guarantee the agent behaves as expected, which simulates a conversation with the agent making sure it does what expected.

[`evaluations/`](https://docs.langwatch.ai/llm-evaluation/offline/code/evaluation-api) notebooks holds dataset and notebooks for evaluating pieces of your agent pipeline such as a RAG or classification tasks it must do

Finally, [`prompts/`](https://docs.langwatch.ai/prompt-management/cli) hold all your versioned prompts in yaml format, synced and controlled by `prompts.json`, to allow for playground and team collaboration.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g @langwatch/better-agents
```

Or use with npx:

```bash
npx @langwatch/better-agents init my-agent-project
```

### Initialize a new project

```bash
# In current directory
better-agents init .

# In a new directory
better-agents init my-awesome-agent
```

The CLI will guide you through selecting your programming language, agent framework, coding assistant, LLM provider, and API keys.
