Universally applicable inpainting ability for every model. LanPaint sampler lets the model "think" through multiple iterations before denoising, enabling you to invest more computation time for superior inpainting quality.  

This is the official implementation of ["LanPaint: Training-Free Diffusion Inpainting with Asymptotically Exact and Fast Conditional Sampling"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03491), accepted by TMLR. 

The repository is for ComfyUI extension.

## Features

- **Universal Compatibility** – Works instantly with almost any model (**Ideogram4, Krea2, Z-image, Z-image-base, Hunyuan, Wan 2.2, Qwen Image/Edit, Anima, HiDream, SD 3.5, Flux-series, SDXL, SD 1.5 or custom LoRAs**) and ControlNet.  
![Inpainting Result 13](https://github.com/scraed/LanPaint/blob/master/examples/InpaintChara_13.jpg) 
- **No Training Needed** – Works out of the box with your existing model.  
- **Easy to Use** – Same workflow as standard ComfyUI KSampler.  
- **Flexible Masking** – Supports any mask shape, size, or position for inpainting/outpainting.  
- **No Workarounds** – Generates 100% new content (no blending or smoothing) without relying on partial denoising.  
- **Beyond Inpainting** – You can even use it as a simple way to generate consistent characters. 
- **Video Mask Editor** – Paint per-frame inpainting masks directly on a video inside ComfyUI (`LanPaint_VideoMaskEditor`): pick the video file, open the editor, paint masks on keyframes, and the masks in between are interpolated automatically with a live preview. Mask = 1 regenerates, 0 keeps.
- **MiniMax H3 Video + Audio Inpainting** – Inpaint video **and audio** in one pass: paint per-frame video masks and audio intervals in the same editor, encode both streams into one nested latent (`LanPaint_AVEncode`), sample, then `LanPaint_AVDecode` merges the inpainted video/audio back into the original with a mask-blended boundary, preserving the source fps and bit depth.
- **Masks Live in the Video** – The editor can export the painted masks into the video file itself (mp4 metadata, via a new "masked" copy - the original is never modified). Share that single mp4 and the recipient gets the masks back automatically when they load it.

**Warning**: LanPaint has degraded performance on distillation models, such as Flux.dev, due to a similar [issue with LORA training](https://medium.com/@zhiwangshi28/why-flux-lora-so-hard-to-train-and-how-to-overcome-it-a0c70bc59eaf). Please use low flux guidance (1.0-2.0) to mitigate this [issue](https://github.com/scraed/LanPaint/issues/30).

## Quickstart

1. **Install ComfyUI**: Follow the official [ComfyUI installation guide](https://docs.comfy.org/get_started) to set up ComfyUI on your system. Or ensure your ComfyUI version > 0.3.11.
2. **Install ComfyUI-Manager**: Add the [ComfyUI-Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager) for easy extension management.  
3. **Install LanPaint Nodes**:  
   - **Via ComfyUI-Manager**: Search for "[LanPaint](https://registry.comfy.org/publishers/scraed/nodes/LanPaint)" in the manager and install it directly.  
   - **Manually**: Click "Install via Git URL" in ComfyUI-Manager and input the GitHub repository link:  
     ```
     https://github.com/scraed/LanPaint.git
     ```  
     Alternatively, clone this repository into the `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` folder.  
4. **Restart ComfyUI**: Restart ComfyUI to load the LanPaint nodes.  

Once installed, you'll find the LanPaint nodes under the "sampling" category in ComfyUI. Use them just like the default KSampler for high-quality inpainting!


## **How to Use Examples:**  
1. Navigate to the **example** folder (i.e example_1), download all pictures.  
2. Drag **InPainted_Drag_Me_to_ComfyUI.png** into ComfyUI to load the workflow.  
3. Download the required model (i.e clicking **Model Used in This Example**).  
4. Load the model in ComfyUI.
5. Upload **Masked_Load_Me_in_Loader.png** to the **"Load image"** node in the **"Mask image for inpainting"** group (second from left), or the **Prepare Image** node.  
7. Queue the task, you will get inpainted results from LanPaint. Some example also gives you inpainted results from the following methods for comparison:
   - **[VAE Encode for Inpainting](https://comfyanonymous.github.io/ComfyUI_examples/inpaint/)**
   - **[Set Latent Noise Mask](https://comfyui-wiki.com/en/tutorial/basic/how-to-inpaint-an-image-in-comfyui)**

## Video Examples

LanPaint now supports video inpainting with Wan 2.2, enabling you to seamlessly inpaint masked regions across video frames while maintaining temporal consistency.

**Note:** LanPaint supports video inpainting for longer sequences (e.g., 81 frames), but processing time increases significantly (please check the [Resource Consumption](#resource-consumption) section for details) and performance may become unstable. For optimal results and stability, we recommend limiting video inpainting to **40 frames or fewer**.

### Wan 2.2 Video Inpainting 

*Example: Wan2.2 t2v 14B, 480p video (11:6), 40 frames, LanPaint K Sampler, 2 steps of thinking*

| Original Video | Mask (Add a white hat) | Inpainted Result |
|:--------------:|:----:|:----------------:|
| ![Original Video](https://github.com/scraed/LanPaint/blob/master/examples/Original_No_Mask_example17.gif) | ![Mask](https://github.com/scraed/LanPaint/blob/master/examples/Example_17/Masked_Load_Me_in_Loader.png) | ![Inpainted Result](https://github.com/scraed/LanPaint/blob/master/examples/Inpainted_40frames_Drag_Me_to_ComfyUI_example17.gif) |

[View Workflow & Masks](https://github.com/scraed/LanPaint/tree/master/examples/Example_17)

You need to follow the ComfyUI version of [Wan2.2 T2V workflow](https://docs.comfy.org/tutorials/video/wan/wan2_2) to download and install the T2V model.

### Wan 2.2 5B Video Inpainting 

Similar to Wan 2.2 14B with slightly different workflow. [View Workflow & Masks](https://github.com/scraed/LanPaint/tree/master/examples/Example_17)

### Wan 2.2 Video Outpainting

Extend your videos beyond their original boundaries with LanPaint's video outpainting capability based on Wan 2.2. This feature allows you to expand the canvas of your videos while maintaining coherent motion and context.

*Example: Wan2.2 t2v 14B, 480p video (1:1 outpaint to 11:6), 40 frames, LanPaint K Sampler, 2 steps of thinking*

| Original Video | Mask (Expand to 880x480) | Outpainted Result |
|:--------------:|:----:|:-----------------:|

[View Workflow & Masks](https://github.com/scraed/LanPaint/tree/master/examples/Example_19)

You need to follow the ComfyUI version of [Wan2.2 T2V workflow](https://docs.comfy.org/tutorials/video/wan/wan2_2) to download and install the T2V model.

### MiniMax H3 Video + Audio Inpainting (AV pipeline)

LanPaint's AV pipeline inpaints video **and audio** together with the MiniMax H3 model. Paint both masks in one editor session, run a single sampler pass on the nested AV latent, and get back a merged video at the original fps and bit depth.

*Example: MiniMax H3, 864x480, 124 frames, LanPaint Sampler Custom (Advanced)*

| Masked Input (paint in the editor) | Mask (visible overlay) | Inpainted Result |
|:----------------------------------:|:----------------------:|:----------------:|
| ![Masked Video](https://github.com/scraed/LanPaint/blob/master/examples/Example_29/Masked_LoadMe.gif) | ![Mask Overlay](https://github.com/scraed/LanPaint/blob/master/examples/Example_29/Masked_LoadMe_MaskOverlay.gif) | ![Inpainted Video](https://github.com/scraed/LanPaint/blob/master/examples/Example_29/InPainted_Drag_Me_to_ComfyUI.gif) |

[View Workflow & Masks](https://github.com/scraed/LanPaint/tree/master/examples/Example_29) · [Workflow JSON](https://github.com/scraed/LanPaint/blob/master/example_workflows/MiniMax_H3_AV_EncodeDecode_Inpaint.json)

**How it works:**
1. `LanPaint_VideoMaskEditor` – pick the video, open the editor, paint per-frame video masks on keyframes (SDF-interpolated in between) and drag audio intervals on the waveform. Mask = 1 regenerates, 0 keeps.
2. `LanPaint_AVEncode` – encodes the video frames and the audio track into one nested latent with the masks attached.
3. Run the sampler as usual (the audio stream runs on its own shifted sigma schedule).
4. `LanPaint_AVDecode` – decodes the nested latent, merges the inpainted video with the original (mask-blended boundary) and the inpainted audio inside the masked intervals (with a short crossfade), and writes the result at the original fps and bit depth.

**Export masks into the video:** the editor's **Export mask video** button remuxes a new `<name>_masked.mp4` copy with the masks embedded in the file metadata (the original file is never modified). Open that file in the editor later - or share it with someone - and the masks are restored automatically.

Download the models from [MiniMax H3 on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-H3) and follow the [ComfyUI MiniMax H3 docs](https://docs.comfy.org/tutorials/video/minimax/minimax_h3).

<sub>**Test Platform**: All tests were conducted on an NVIDIA RTX Pro 6000.<br>
**Model Used**: `wan2.2_t2v_low_noise_14B_fp8_scaled.safetensors` and `wan2.2_t2v_high_noise_14B_fp8_scaled.safetensors`.<br>
**Processing Steps**:  20 sampling steps x 2 (LanPaint steps of thinking).</sub>

**Note:** Vram is required by the model, not LanPaint. To further reduce VRAM requirements, we recommend generating less frames and loading CLIP on CPU.

### Example Z-image-base: InPaint(LanPaint K Sampler, 3 steps of thinking)
LanPaint also supports inpainting with the Z-image-base model.

**Warning (stability)**: Z-image-base can easily diverge with LanPaint. Start with **small `LanPaint_StepSize`** and **fewer thinking iterations** (lower `LanPaint_NumSteps`) and increase gradually only if stable.

### Example Wan2.2: Partial InPaint(LanPaint K Sampler, 5 steps of thinking)
Sometimes we don't want to inpaint completely new content, but rather let the inpainted image reference the original image. One option to achieve this is to inpaint with an edit model like Qwen Image Edit. Another option is to perform a partial inpaint: allowing the diffusion process to start at some middle steps rather than from 0.

## Usage

**Workflow Setup**  
Same as default ComfyUI KSampler - simply replace with LanPaint KSampler nodes. The inpainting workflow is the same as the [SetLatentNoiseMask](https://comfyui-wiki.com/zh/comfyui-nodes/latent/inpaint/set-latent-noise-mask) inpainting workflow.

**Note**
- LanPaint requires binary masks (values of 0 or 1) without opacity or smoothing. To ensure compatibility, set the mask's **opacity and hardness to maximum** in your mask editor. During inpainting, any mask with smoothing or gradients will automatically be converted to a binary mask.
- LanPaint relies heavily on your text prompts to guide inpainting - explicitly describe the content you want generated in the masked area. If results show artifacts or mismatched elements, counteract them with targeted negative prompts.

## Basic Sampler
![Samplers](https://github.com/scraed/LanPaint/blob/master/Nodes.JPG)  

- LanPaint KSampler: The most basic and easy to use sampler for inpainting.
- LanPaint KSampler (Advanced): Full control of all parameters.

### LanPaint KSampler
Simplified interface with recommended defaults:

- Steps: 20 - 50. More steps will give more "thinking" and better results.
- LanPaint NumSteps: The turns of thinking before denoising. Recommend 5 for most of tasks ( which means 5 times slower than sampling without thinking). Use 10 for more challenging tasks. 
- LanPaint Prompt mode: Image First mode and Prompt First mode. Image First mode focuses on the image, inpaint based on image context (maybe ignore prompt), while Prompt First mode focuses more on the prompt. Use Prompt First mode for tasks like character consistency. (Technically, it Prompt First mode change CFG scale to negative value in the BIG score to emphasis prompt, which will costs image quality.)

### LanPaint KSampler (Advanced)
Full parameter control:
**Key Parameters**

| Parameter | Range | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `Steps` | 0-100 | Total steps of diffusion sampling. Higher means better inpainting. Recommend 20-50. |
| `LanPaint_NumSteps` | 0-20 | Reasoning iterations per denoising step ("thinking depth"). Easy task: 2-5. Hard task: 5-10 |
| `LanPaint_Lambda` | 0.1-50 | Content alignment strength (higher = stricter). Recommend 4.0 - 10.0 |
| `LanPaint_StepSize` | 0.1-1.0 | The StepSize of each thinking step. Recommend 0.1-0.5. |
| `LanPaint_Beta` | 0.1-2.0 | The StepSize ratio between masked / unmasked region. Small value can compensate high lambda values. Recommend 1.0 |
| `LanPaint_Friction` | 0.0-100.0 | The friction of Langevin dynamics. Higher means more slow but stable, lower means fast but unstable. Recommend 10.0 - 20.0|
| `LanPaint_EarlyStop` | 0-10 | Stop LanPaint iteration before the final sampling step. Helps to remove artifacts in some cases. Recommend 1-5|
| `LanPaint_PromptMode` | Image First / Prompt First | Image First mode focuses on the image context, maybe ignore prompt. Prompt First mode focuses more on the prompt. |

For detailed descriptions of each parameter, simply hover your mouse over the corresponding input field to view tooltips with additional information.

### LanPaint Mask Blend
This node blends the original image with the inpainted image based on the mask. It is useful if you want the unmasked region to match the original image pixel perfectly.

## LanPaint KSampler (Advanced) Tuning Guide
For challenging inpainting tasks:  

1️⃣ **Boost Quality**
Increase **total number of sampling steps** (very important!), **LanPaint_NumSteps** (thinking iterations) or **LanPaint_Lambda** if the inpainted result does not meet your expectations.
  
2️⃣ **Boost Speed**
Decrease **LanPaint_NumSteps** to accelerate generation! If you want better results but still need fewer steps, consider:
    - **Increasing LanPaint_StepSize** to speed up the thinking process.
    - **Decreasing LanPaint_Friction** to make the Langevin dynamics converges more faster.
    
3️⃣ **Fix Unstability**:  
If you find the results have wired texture, try
- Reduce **LanPaint_Friction** to make the Langevin dynamics more stable. 
- Reduce **LanPaint_StepSize** to use smaller step size.
- Reduce **LanPaint_Beta** if you are using a high lambda value.

⚠️ **Notes**:  
- For effective tuning, **fix the seed** and adjust parameters incrementally while observing the results. This helps isolate the impact of each setting.  Better to do it with a batche of images to avoid overfitting on a single image.
