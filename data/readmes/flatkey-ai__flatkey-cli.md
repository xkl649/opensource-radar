Website: [flatkey.ai](https://flatkey.ai/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=flatkey_cli)

```bash
npm install -g @flatkey-ai/cli
flatkey login

flatkey image generate --prompt "editorial cover, neon city at dawn" -o cover.png
flatkey video generate --prompt "cinematic product launch clip" --model seedance2 -o launch.mp4
flatkey audio generate --prompt "你好，这是 Flatkey 的配音测试" -o speech.mp3
flatkey models --json
flatkey credits --json
```

## Why Flatkey CLI

- One CLI for image, video, audio, and text generation.
- One `FLATKEY_API_KEY`, one credit balance.
- Agent-friendly JSON mode with clean stdout.
- Local output support with `--output` / `-o`.
- Cross-platform npm package for macOS, Linux, and Windows.
- Cool terminal progress animation for human runs; disabled in `--json` mode.

## Product Comparison

Flatkey is built for media teams that want programmatic generation without paying a premium for a closed creative suite or waiting in long queues. Higgsfield is strong for creator-facing workflows, and Dreamina/Jimeng has good ByteDance video models, but both can become expensive or slow once the workflow moves from manual creation to repeated AI-agent testing. In our testing, Dreamina/Jimeng video generation can wait up to 5 hours during peak time, which makes one-by-one prompt iteration impractical.

| Need | Flatkey | Higgsfield | Dreamina / Jimeng |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cost for repeat testing | Flatkey token pricing is at least ~20% lower than comparable retail routes, and some modalities such as image can be ~40% lower. | Credit packages can be expensive once premium video/image models are used heavily. | Subscription credits can be cheaper in some local workflows, but API-style automation usually has plan and region constraints. |
| Programmatic access | First-class CLI and API-router workflow. Designed for agents, scripts, and batch testing. | Strong product UI for creators; CLI-style automation is not the primary product promise. | CLI/API access is gated behind higher-tier setup in many workflows, not the default creator entry path. |
| Queue / iteration speed | Built for fast CLI retries, `--dry-run`, local outputs, and unified model routing. | Good for polished creator workflows, but heavy credit usage makes broad testing costly. | Peak-time queues can block video iteration; we have observed waits up to 5 hours for a single video generation test. |
| Modalities | Image, video, TTS, SFX, music, text, credits, status, and model discovery behind one Flatkey key. | Strong image/video creator stack and media tooling. | Strong ByteDance image/video models, especially Seedance/Dreamina-style workflows. |
| Agent ergonomics | `--json`, `--output/-o`, `--dry-run`, `models`, `audio voices`, and predictable stdout/stderr. | More oriented around human creative workflows. | More oriented around app/product workflow than simple agent protocol. |
| Best fit | Media teams building repeatable generation pipelines and AI-agent workflows. | Creators who want a polished visual production suite. | Teams already deep in CapCut/Dreamina/Jimeng ecosystem and willing to accept plan/queue tradeoffs. |

In short: use Flatkey when the job is repeated media generation, cost-sensitive testing, and AI-agent automation. Use creator suites when you want their native editing UI more than a programmable router.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @flatkey-ai/cli
```

Run without installing:

```bash
npx @flatkey-ai/cli help --ai
```

Check local version:

```bash
flatkey --version
flatkey -v
```

## Auth

Recommended: sign in through the Flatkey console:

```bash
flatkey login
```

`flatkey login` opens a browser authorization page, waits for approval, then saves the CLI API key and account metadata in your local Flatkey config. After login, check the active auth state:

```bash
flatkey auth status
flatkey status --json
```

If your terminal cannot open a browser automatically, print the approval URL and open it yourself:

```bash
flatkey login --no-open
```

For staging or self-hosted console testing:

```bash
flatkey login --console-url https://console.flatkey.ai
```

To remove the saved API key:

```bash
flatkey logout
```

Alternative: use an environment variable:

```bash
export FLATKEY_API_KEY=<key>
```

Or save a manually created key locally:

```bash
flatkey onboard --api-key <key>
```

Create a key at [console.flatkey.ai/keys](https://console.flatkey.ai/keys), then pass it with `--api-key`.

## Commands

### Generate Image

```bash
flatkey image generate \
  --prompt "magazine cover, reflective typography, studio lighting" \
  --model gpt-image-2 \
  -o cover.png
```

Upload a local image and get a temporary signed URL:

```bash
flatkey image upload --file ./reference.png
```

### Generate Video

```bash
flatkey video generate \
  --prompt "8 second cinematic product reveal, glossy black background" \
  --model seedance2 \
  --ratio 16:9 \
  --resolution 720p \
  -o launch.mp4
```

Video ratios: `16:9`, `9:16`, `4:3`, `3:4`, `21:9`, `1:1`.
Video resolutions: `480p`, `720p`, `1080p`.

Local reference images are uploaded through Flatkey temporary media first:

```bash
flatkey video generate \
  --model Seedance2.0-pro \
  --prompt "a sleepy kitten, soft window light" \
  --image ./reference.png \
  -o kitten.mp4
```

First/last frame:

```bash
flatkey video generate \
  --model Seedance2.0-pro \
  --prompt "slow camera push-in" \
  --first-frame ./first.png \
  --last-frame ./last.png \
  -o transition.mp4
```

### Generate Audio

Text to speech:

```bash
flatkey audio generate \
  --prompt "你好，这是 Flatkey 网关的语音测试。" \
  --voice-id EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL \
  --model eleven_multilingual_v2 \
  --stability 0.5 \
  --similarity-boost 0.75 \
  --style 0 \
  -o speech.mp3
```

List voices:

```bash
flatkey audio voices --json
```

Sound effects:

```bash
flatkey audio sfx \
  --prompt "glass shattering on the floor" \
  --duration 3 \
  -o sfx.mp3
```

Music:

```bash
flatkey audio music \
  --prompt "calm ambient piano, sad mood" \
  --music-length-ms 10000 \
  -o music.mp3
```

### Generate Text

```bash
flatkey text generate \
  --prompt "write 5 sharp headlines for a creator tool launch" \
  --model gpt-5.5 \
  -o headlines.txt
```

### Credits, Status, Models

```bash
flatkey credits --json
flatkey status --json
flatkey models --json
flatkey models --type image --json
flatkey help --ai
```

## Models

Live model list:

```bash
flatkey models --json
```

Useful current defaults:

| Type | Models |
| --- | --- |
| Image | `gpt-image-2`, `nano-banana-pro-preview`, Gemini image models |
| Video | `seedance2`, `veo-3`, `veo-3-fast` |
| Audio | `eleven_multilingual_v2`, ElevenLabs voices, sound effects, music |
| Text | `gpt-5.5`, Claude, Gemini, GLM, Grok models |

`models` reads from the Flatkey console model registry. Generation calls use the Flatkey router.

## Agent Protocol

Use this when wiring Flatkey into Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, or other agents:

```bash
flatkey help --ai
```

Agent rules:

- Prefer `FLATKEY_API_KEY`.
- Always pass `--json` for machine-readable output.
- Use `--output` / `-o` when the generated file path matters.
- Use `flatkey image upload --file <path>` for a temporary signed image URL.
- Use `--image`, `--first-frame`, or `--last-frame` to pass local images into video generation.
- Call `flatkey models --json` before choosing a model.
- Call `flatkey audio voices --json` before choosing a TTS `voice_id`.
- Use `--dry-run` to inspect request shape without spending credits.

Example dry run:

```bash
flatkey video generate \
  --prompt "fashion campaign hero shot" \
  --model seedance2 \
  --dry-run \
  --json
```

## Routing

- Generation router: `https://router.flatkey.ai`
- Model registry: `https://console.flatkey.ai/v1/available_models`
- Voice registry: `https://router.flatkey.ai/v1/voices`

Override router only when developing or testing:

```bash
flatkey image generate --prompt "test" --base-url http://127.0.0.1:3000 --json
```
