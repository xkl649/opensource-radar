```bash
# One front door — init + doctor + status
npx @cobusgreyling/loop init . --pattern daily-triage --tool grok
npx @cobusgreyling/loop doctor .
```

`loop init` scaffolds skills, state, and budget files, then prints your **Loop Ready** score. `loop doctor` turns audit + sync into top-3 next actions. Swap `--tool` for `claude`, `codex`, or `opencode`. Optional: `--with-foundry` for a versioned harness stack. Legacy `npx @cobusgreyling/loop-init .` still works. See [docs/cli-front-door.md](docs/cli-front-door.md).

Loop engineering replaces you as the person who prompts the agent — you design the system that does it instead.

### Ecosystem stack

```
memory-engineering → loop-engineering → harness-foundry → outerloop → fleet-engineering
   (persist)            (patterns)         (runtime)        (verdict)     (population)
```

| Layer | You get | Start |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Memory** | Tiers, recall budget, Memory Ready score | [memory-engineering](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/memory-engineering) |
| **Design** (this repo) | Patterns, starters, Loop Ready score | `npx @cobusgreyling/loop init .` then `loop doctor .` |
| **Runtime** | Versioned harness, traces, evolve | `npx @cobusgreyling/loop init . --with-foundry` or [Foundry showcase](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/harness-foundry/blob/main/docs/showcase.md) |
| **Govern** | Evidence, verdict, answerability | [outerloop](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/outerloop) |
| **Fleet** | Registry, inbox, budgets, kill switch | `npx @cobusgreyling/fleet-init .` · [Fleet Ready](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/fleet-engineering/blob/main/docs/fleet-ready-score.md) |

**Scale beyond one loop:** when agents forget across sessions, add [memory-engineering](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/memory-engineering). When you have many agents/loops on a team, add [fleet-engineering](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/fleet-engineering).

**Next after Loop Ready 80+:** version the loop as a harness — `loop-init` prints the CTA automatically; `loop-audit` recommends Foundry when the score is strong but `.foundry/stack.yaml` is missing.

## Why This Matters

Peter Steinberger:
> “You shouldn’t be prompting coding agents anymore. You should be designing loops that prompt your agents.”

Boris Cherny (Head of Claude Code at Anthropic):
> “I don’t prompt Claude anymore. I have loops running that prompt Claude and figuring out what to do. My job is to write loops.”

The leverage point has moved from crafting individual prompts to designing the control systems that orchestrate agents over time.

## The Five Building Blocks + Memory

| Primitive | Job in the Loop |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Automations / Scheduling** | Discovery + triage on a cadence |
| **Worktrees** | Safe parallel execution |
| **Skills** | Persistent project knowledge |
| **Plugins & Connectors** | Reach into your real tools (MCP) |
| **Sub-agents** | Maker / checker split |
| **+ Memory / State** | Durable spine outside any conversation |

Deeper diagrams — the actor-level sequence within one run, the run lifecycle's states, autonomy levels L1-L3, and how `tools/` maps onto the primitives — live in [docs/architecture-diagrams.md](docs/architecture-diagrams.md).

**This reference repo now runs its own `validate-patterns` + `audit` workflows on every push/PR** (see `.github/workflows/`). We also added `LOOP.md` describing the loops that will maintain it.

## Patterns

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cobusgreyling/loop-engineering@main/assets/visuals/patterns-overview.svg" alt="Seven production loop patterns with cadence and token cost" width="100%" />
</p>

| Pattern | Cadence | Starter | Week 1 | Token cost |
|---------|---------|---------|--------|------------|
| [Daily Triage](patterns/daily-triage.md) | 1d–2h | [minimal-loop](starters/minimal-loop/) | **L1** report | Low |
| [PR Babysitter](patterns/pr-babysitter.md) | 5–15m | [pr-babysitter](starters/pr-babysitter/) | L1 watch | High |
| [CI Sweeper](patterns/ci-sweeper.md) | 5–15m | [ci-sweeper](starters/ci-sweeper/) | L2 cautious | Very high |
| [Dependency Sweeper](patterns/dependency-sweeper.md) | 6h–1d | [dependency-sweeper](starters/dependency-sweeper/) | L2 patch-only | Medium |
| [Changelog Drafter](patterns/changelog-drafter.md) | 1d or tag | [changelog-drafter](starters/changelog-drafter/) | **L1** draft | Low |
| [Post-Merge Cleanup](patterns/post-merge-cleanup.md) | 1d–6h | [post-merge-cleanup](starters/post-merge-cleanup/) | **L1** off-peak | Low |
| [Issue Triage](patterns/issue-triage.md) | 2h–1d | [issue-triage](starters/issue-triage/) | **L1** propose-only | Low |

Machine-readable index: [patterns/registry.yaml](patterns/registry.yaml) (7 patterns)

## Getting Started (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Scaffold + Loop Ready score (printed automatically)
npx @cobusgreyling/loop init . --pattern daily-triage --tool grok

# 2. One health check (audit + sync + files → top 3 actions)
npx @cobusgreyling/loop doctor .

# 3. Optional: cost estimate / badge / day-2 dashboard
npx @cobusgreyling/loop cost --pattern daily-triage --level L1
npx @cobusgreyling/loop badge .
npx @cobusgreyling/loop status .

# 4. See scores climb: empty → L1 → L2
bash scripts/before-after-demo.sh

# 5. Start report-only (Grok example)
/loop 1d Run loop-triage. Update STATE.md. No auto-fix in week one.
```

**Same as before:** `npx @cobusgreyling/loop-init` and `loop-audit` still work — [CLI front door](docs/cli-front-door.md).

All npm CLIs publish from tagged releases — see [docs/RELEASE.md](docs/RELEASE.md). No clone required.

**Develop from source** (monorepo contributors):

```bash
cd tools/loop && npm ci && npm test && node dist/cli.js doctor ../..
cd tools/loop-init && npm ci && npm test && node dist/cli.js /path/to/project --pattern daily-triage --tool grok
cd tools/loop-audit && npm ci && npm test && node dist/cli.js /path/to/project --suggest
cd tools/loop-cost && npm ci && npm test && node dist/cli.js --pattern ci-sweeper --cadence 15m
```

Phased rollout: **L1 report → L2 assisted fixes → L3 unattended** — see [loop-design-checklist](docs/loop-design-checklist.md).

## Caveats

Loop engineering amplifies judgment — both good and bad.

- **Token costs** can explode with sub-agents and long-running loops.
- **Verification is still on you.** Unattended loops make unattended mistakes.
- **Comprehension debt** grows faster unless you read what the loop ships.
- Two people can run the same loop and get opposite results. The loop doesn't know. You do.

Addy Osmani:
> “Build the loop. But build it like someone who intends to stay the engineer, not just the person who presses go.”
