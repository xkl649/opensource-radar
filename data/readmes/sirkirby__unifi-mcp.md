## Servers

| Server | Status | Tools | Package |

## Cloud Relay

| Component | Status | Package |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| [Relay Sidecar](https://github.com/sirkirby/unifi-mcp/tree/main/packages/unifi-mcp-relay) | Beta | [`unifi-mcp-relay`](https://pypi.org/project/unifi-mcp-relay/) |
| [Worker Gateway](https://github.com/sirkirby/unifi-mcp/tree/main/apps/worker) | Beta | [`unifi-mcp-worker`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/unifi-mcp-worker) (CLI) |

Cloud Relay pairs the Cloudflare-hosted Worker gateway with the Relay sidecar on your LAN. The Worker provides the authenticated edge MCP endpoint, Durable Object broker, multi-location routing, token boundary, and deployment/management CLI. The Relay sidecar is a local MCP HTTP client and forwarder: it discovers configured local MCP servers over HTTP and maintains an outbound WebSocket to the Worker. Remote requests follow `MCP client → Worker gateway → outbound WebSocket → Relay sidecar → local MCP servers over HTTP`; the API server is not in this path. Read-only tools support annotation-based multi-location fan-out, while writes require explicit location targeting. Deploy the Worker with `npm install -g unifi-mcp-worker && unifi-mcp-worker install`, then see the [Relay sidecar README](packages/unifi-mcp-relay/) to connect local servers.

## REST + GraphQL API (non-MCP)

| Component | Status | Package |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| [API Server](https://github.com/sirkirby/unifi-mcp/tree/main/apps/api) | Beta | [`unifi-api-server`](https://pypi.org/project/unifi-api-server/) · [GHCR image](https://github.com/sirkirby/unifi-mcp/pkgs/container/unifi-api-server) |

`unifi-api-server` is an independent HTTP service for consumers that do not speak MCP. It provides typed REST resources, read-only GraphQL queries, SSE streams, scoped API keys and administration, plus a REST action endpoint for supported controller operations. It shares `unifi-core` managers with the MCP servers but does not proxy or require them.

See [`apps/api/README.md`](apps/api/README.md) for quick-start and deployment patterns.

## What is this?

UniFi MCP is a collection of [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers that let AI assistants and automation tools interact with Ubiquiti UniFi controllers. Each server targets a specific UniFi application (Network, Protect, Access) and exposes its functionality as MCP tools — queryable, composable, and safe by default.

## MCP Discovery

UniFi MCP keeps the standard MCP path primary: capable clients discover currently registered tools with `tools/list` and invoke them with `tools/call`. The default `lazy` mode keeps initial context small by exposing meta-tools first, while `eager` mode registers all selected domain tools directly for clients that prefer a full standard tool list.

The lazy-loading meta-tools — `*_tool_index`, `*_execute`, `*_batch`, `*_batch_status`, and lazy-only `*_load_tools` — support filtered discovery, indirect execution, batch orchestration, and optional direct registration. They are independent of the protocol-version response compatibility policy below. See [MCP Discovery and Lazy-Loading Meta-Tools](docs/tool-index.md) for mode-by-mode behavior.

## MCP response size

For tool results that already provide structured output, `adaptive` response mode is the default. It classifies each request by the canonical date-based `protocolVersion` advertised during MCP initialization, not by the client's product name or application version. Requests advertising MCP `2025-06-18` or later receive concise text in `content` and the full result once in `structuredContent`; requests advertising an earlier revision (such as `2024-11-05` or `2025-03-26`), or whose revision metadata is missing or malformed, retain the full compatibility JSON in `content`. Set `UNIFI_MCP_CONTENT_MODE=compat` to force that duplicated compatibility form, or `UNIFI_MCP_CONTENT_MODE=compact` to force concise text plus the full structured result even outside a negotiated request. Use `compat` for any client that consumes the full result only from `content`, regardless of its advertised revision.

The lazy-loading meta-tools remain content-only; they are not the pre-`2025-06-18` protocol category described above. For structured inner results, `*_execute` and `*_batch_status` expose one normalized JSON payload in `content` rather than a nested transport pair; content-only execute results remain unchanged. Response modes do not convert these meta-tools to `structuredContent`.

`UNIFI_NETWORK_MCP_CONTENT_MODE`, `UNIFI_PROTECT_MCP_CONTENT_MODE`, and `UNIFI_ACCESS_MCP_CONTENT_MODE` override the global setting for their respective servers. Independently of transport compaction, Network's `unifi_get_dashboard` defaults to `summary=true`, while `unifi_list_rogue_aps` defaults to a summarized page of at most 100 records; pass `summary=false` when the full selected data is required.

## Quick Start

### Claude Code (recommended)

Install via the plugin marketplace — includes the MCP server, an agent skill, and guided setup:

```
/plugin marketplace add sirkirby/unifi-mcp
/plugin install unifi-network@unifi-plugins
/unifi-network:unifi-network-setup
```

Repeat for Protect or Access if needed:
```
/plugin install unifi-protect@unifi-plugins
/plugin install unifi-access@unifi-plugins
```

Each plugin's setup command walks you through connecting to your controller and configuring permissions.

### Codex

Register the UniFi MCP marketplace, then install the plugins from Codex's `/plugins` UI:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add sirkirby/unifi-mcp
```

Launch `codex`, run `/plugins`, open the UniFi MCP marketplace, and install `unifi-network`, `unifi-protect`, or `unifi-access`. After installing, ask Codex to run the plugin's setup skill, for example:

> Use the `unifi-network-setup` skill to configure this for Codex.

The setup skill registers the MCP server with `codex mcp add`, stores the selected environment values in Codex's MCP configuration, and keeps the same preview-before-confirm safety model as Claude Code.

### UniFi account requirements

The MCP servers authenticate to the local UniFi controller APIs with a local admin/service account. Do not use a Ubiquiti SSO cloud account for MCP setup. For Network MCP today, accounts that require SSO MFA or local 2FA are not supported through configuration; use a dedicated local admin account without MFA for the service account, scoped to the permissions you are comfortable giving the MCP server.

### OpenClaw

OpenClaw can install the same UniFi plugin bundles from the marketplace and map their skills plus MCP server definitions into embedded Pi sessions:

```bash
openclaw plugins install unifi-network --marketplace https://github.com/sirkirby/unifi-mcp
openclaw gateway restart
```

Then run the matching setup skill from OpenClaw (`unifi-network-setup`, `unifi-protect-setup`, or `unifi-access-setup`), or configure the server directly:

```bash
openclaw mcp set unifi-network '{
  "command": "uvx",
  "args": ["--python-preference", "system", "unifi-network-mcp@latest"],
  "env": {
    "UNIFI_NETWORK_HOST": "192.168.1.1",
    "UNIFI_NETWORK_USERNAME": "admin",
    "UNIFI_NETWORK_PASSWORD": "your-password"
  }
}'
```

Repeat with `unifi-protect` or `unifi-access` as needed. Restart the OpenClaw Gateway after changing MCP server configuration.

### Other MCP clients

Run the servers directly:

```bash
uvx unifi-network-mcp@latest
uvx unifi-protect-mcp@latest
uvx unifi-access-mcp@latest
```

For Claude Desktop, add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unifi-network": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["unifi-network-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        // Server-specific vars take priority; UNIFI_* is the fallback
        "UNIFI_NETWORK_HOST": "192.168.1.1",
        "UNIFI_NETWORK_USERNAME": "admin",
        "UNIFI_NETWORK_PASSWORD": "your-password"
      }
    },
    "unifi-protect": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["unifi-protect-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "UNIFI_PROTECT_HOST": "192.168.1.1",
        "UNIFI_PROTECT_USERNAME": "admin",
        "UNIFI_PROTECT_PASSWORD": "your-password"
      }
    },
    "unifi-access": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["unifi-access-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "UNIFI_ACCESS_HOST": "192.168.1.1",
        "UNIFI_ACCESS_USERNAME": "admin",
        "UNIFI_ACCESS_PASSWORD": "your-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Tip:** If all servers connect to the same controller, you can use the shared `UNIFI_HOST` / `UNIFI_USERNAME` / `UNIFI_PASSWORD` variables instead of repeating them per server.

## Usage Examples

Once connected, just ask your AI agent in natural language:

**Network**
> "Show me all clients on the Guest VLAN with their signal strength and data usage"
> "Create a firewall rule that blocks IoT devices from reaching the internet between midnight and 6 AM"
> "Audit my firewall policies — are there any redundant or conflicting rules?"
> "Show me the top traffic flows from the last hour and group them by destination"

**Protect**
> "List all cameras that detected motion in the last hour"
> "Show me smart detection events from the front door camera today — people and vehicles only"
> "Find driveway detections for white vans this week"

**Access**
> "Who badged into the office today? Show me a timeline of all door access events"
> "Create a visitor pass for John Smith with access to the main entrance tomorrow 9-5"

**Cross-Product** (requires [relay](packages/unifi-mcp-relay/) for full experience)
> "Show me everything that happened at the front entrance in the last hour" — correlates Network clients, Protect camera events, and Access badge scans in a single timeline
> "A switch went offline at 2 AM — was there physical activity nearby?"

All mutations use a **preview-then-confirm** flow — you see exactly what will change before anything is applied.

## Configuration

Set these environment variables (or use a `.env` file):

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `UNIFI_HOST` | Yes | Controller IP or hostname |
| `UNIFI_USERNAME` | Yes | Local admin/service account username; do not use a Ubiquiti SSO account |
| `UNIFI_PASSWORD` | Yes | Password for the local account |
| `UNIFI_API_KEY` | No | UniFi API key for selected capabilities, including firewall policy ordering and some Protect settings updates |

### Multi-controller setups

Each server supports its own prefixed environment variables that take priority over the shared `UNIFI_*` variables. This lets you point the Network and Protect servers at different controllers (or different credentials) while keeping a single `.env` file:

| Shared (fallback) | Network server | Protect server | Access server |
|--------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| `UNIFI_HOST` | `UNIFI_NETWORK_HOST` | `UNIFI_PROTECT_HOST` | `UNIFI_ACCESS_HOST` |
| `UNIFI_USERNAME` | `UNIFI_NETWORK_USERNAME` | `UNIFI_PROTECT_USERNAME` | `UNIFI_ACCESS_USERNAME` |
| `UNIFI_PASSWORD` | `UNIFI_NETWORK_PASSWORD` | `UNIFI_PROTECT_PASSWORD` | `UNIFI_ACCESS_PASSWORD` |
| `UNIFI_PORT` | `UNIFI_NETWORK_PORT` | `UNIFI_PROTECT_PORT` | `UNIFI_ACCESS_PORT` |
| `UNIFI_VERIFY_SSL` | `UNIFI_NETWORK_VERIFY_SSL` | `UNIFI_PROTECT_VERIFY_SSL` | `UNIFI_ACCESS_VERIFY_SSL` |
| `UNIFI_API_KEY` | `UNIFI_NETWORK_API_KEY` | `UNIFI_PROTECT_API_KEY` | `UNIFI_ACCESS_API_KEY` |

**Single controller?** Just set the shared `UNIFI_*` variables -- all servers will use them. Server-specific variables are only needed when the servers talk to different controllers or use different credentials.

For the full configuration reference including permissions, transports, and advanced options, see the [Network server docs](apps/network/docs/configuration.md), [Protect server docs](apps/protect/docs/configuration.md), or [Access server docs](apps/access/docs/configuration.md).

## Secret redaction

Tool and API responses redact known controller secret fields by default — Wi-Fi passphrases, VPN private/preshared keys, whole VPN config blobs (imported WireGuard/OpenVPN `.conf`/`.ovpn` files), API tokens, SNMP community strings, and Access credential token/PIN values come back as `***REDACTED***`. This keeps secrets out of agent context and logs.

When a trusted local administration workflow genuinely needs raw values, disable redaction for that process with `UNIFI_REDACT_SENSITIVE_FIELDS=false` or a server-specific override such as `UNIFI_NETWORK_REDACT_SENSITIVE_FIELDS=false`, `UNIFI_PROTECT_REDACT_SENSITIVE_FIELDS=false`, `UNIFI_ACCESS_REDACT_SENSITIVE_FIELDS=false`, or `UNIFI_API_REDACT_SENSITIVE_FIELDS=false`. To keep an existing secret during an update, simply omit the field — do **not** pass the `***REDACTED***` marker back; doing so is rejected so the placeholder can never be written as a real secret. See [`PRIVACY.md`](PRIVACY.md) for the full list of redacted fields.

## Agent Skills

Each plugin ships with agent skills that go beyond raw tool access — they teach agents how to perform common tasks effectively:

| Skill | Plugin | What it does |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Network Health Check** | unifi-network | Batch diagnostics across devices, health subsystems, and alarms with reference docs for interpreting results |
| **Firewall Manager** | unifi-network | Natural language firewall management with policy templates, config snapshots, and change tracking |
| **Firewall Auditor** | unifi-network | Security audit with 16 benchmarks, 100-point scoring, topology analysis, and trend tracking |
| **Security Digest** | unifi-protect | Cross-product event intelligence — summarizes camera, door, and network events with severity classification and correlation rules |
| **UniFi Access** | unifi-access | Door control, credentials, visitors, access policies — with real-time event streaming and activity summaries |

Skills include reference documentation (device states, alarm types, firewall schemas, event catalogs) and Python scripts for deterministic operations (auditing, config export/diff, template application).

## Architecture

This is a monorepo with shared packages:

```
apps/
  network/          # UniFi Network MCP server (stable, 189 tools)
  protect/          # UniFi Protect MCP server (stable, 61 tools)
  access/           # UniFi Access MCP server (stable, 36 tools)
  api/              # Independent REST + GraphQL API server (beta)
  worker/           # Cloudflare Worker gateway + npm CLI
packages/
  unifi-core/       # Shared UniFi connectivity (auth, detection, retry)
  unifi-mcp-shared/ # Shared MCP patterns (permissions, tools, diagnostics, config)
  unifi-mcp-relay/  # Cloud relay sidecar (bridges local servers to Cloudflare Worker)
plugins/
  unifi-network/    # Claude Code/Codex/OpenClaw plugin: MCP server + agent skills + setup
  unifi-protect/    # Claude Code/Codex/OpenClaw plugin: MCP server + agent skills + setup
  unifi-access/     # Claude Code/Codex/OpenClaw plugin: MCP server + setup
skills/
  _shared/          # Shared utilities for skill scripts (MCP client, config)
docs/               # Ecosystem-level documentation
```

Each Python server in `apps/` is an independent package that depends on the shared packages. `apps/worker/` is intentionally separate: it is a self-contained TypeScript/Node app for the Cloudflare Worker gateway and npm CLI. Keeping it in this repo lets relay protocol changes and worker contract tests move together.

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for details.
