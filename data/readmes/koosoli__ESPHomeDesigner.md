---

## What Does It Do?

- **Visual drag-and-drop editor** - Design layouts in your browser, see your actual HA entities update live on the canvas
- **Multi-Platform Export** - One design, multiple outputs:
  - **ESPHome**: Native C++ lambda code or LVGL YAML for ESP32 devices with direct display control
  - **OpenEpaperLink (OEPL)**: JSON service calls for wireless e-paper tags via the OEPL Access Point
  - **OpenDisplay (ODP)**: JSON action payloads for HTTP-driven displays
- **Flexible Data Sources** - Connect widgets to Home Assistant entities or **MQTT topics** directly with no extra configuration needed.
- **Multi-Page "World View"** - Manage all your project pages on a single unified stage with artboard-style rendering.
- **Plugin-Based Architecture** - 55+ independent widget modules for everything from sensors and graphs to polygons and complex patterns.
- **Round-trip editing** - Import existing ESPHome configs, OEPL YAML arrays, or ODP JSON payloads back into the editor.
- **AI-Powered Dashboard Assistant** - Generate entire layouts or individual widgets from simple text prompts.
- **Conditional Visibility** - Show or hide any widget based on Home Assistant entity state (binary, numeric, text, and range conditions).
- **Time-Based Page Scheduling** - Assign visibility windows to pages so your device automatically shows the right content at the right time.
- **Full device integration** - Exposes buttons, buzzer, temperature, and humidity sensors back to HA for automations.
- **Smart power management** - Battery monitoring, configurable refresh intervals, and hardware-aware energy saving strategies.

**Use case:** Display a weather page when you wake up, switch to a sensor dashboard during the day, show a specific alert page when the doorbell rings - all automated through Home Assistant.

## Quick Start

### Installation (pick one)

#### 1. Live Web Version (Easiest)

You can use the designer without installing anything! 

1. Go to [koosoli.github.io/ESPHomeDesigner/](https://koosoli.github.io/ESPHomeDesigner/)
2. Open **Editor Settings** (gear icon)
3. Enter your Home Assistant URL and a **Long-Lived Access Token** (created in your HA profile)
4. Add the designer URL to your HA `cors_allowed_origins` (see below)

#### 2. Install via HACS (Recommended)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=koosoli&repository=ESPHomeDesigner&category=Integration)

1. Add `https://github.com/koosoli/ESPHomeDesigner` to HACS as a custom repository
2. Search for "ESPHome Designer" and install
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Go to **Settings** -> **Devices & Services** -> **Add Integration** -> Search for "ESPHome Designer"

#### 3. Manual Installation

1. Download the `custom_components/esphome_designer` folder from this repo
2. Copy it to your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Add the integration via **Settings** -> **Devices & Services**

### Where Home Assistant Stores Your Data

When you run ESPHome Designer inside Home Assistant, your saved layouts are stored in Home Assistant's storage folder:

- **Layouts and editor state**: `/config/.storage/esphome_designer`
- **Custom layouts you create in the editor**: saved inside that same `/config/.storage/esphome_designer` file as separate layout entries
- **Manual edits made in the YAML snippet box**: saved inside the active layout entry in `/config/.storage/esphome_designer` as part of the layout state, not as a standalone ESPHome device YAML file
- **Legacy installs (0.8.6.2 and older)**: may still have old data in `/config/.storage/reterminal_dashboard`; the integration can read that and migrate it on a later save
- **Uploaded custom hardware profiles**: `/config/esphomedesigner_custom_profiles/*.yaml`

If you are browsing the Home Assistant filesystem from the host OS, replace `/config` with your actual Home Assistant configuration directory.

### How Saving and YAML Import Work

- **Save Layout** saves the current canvas, layout settings, and any persisted manual YAML override to the active layout in Home Assistant storage. It does **not** automatically overwrite your real ESPHome device YAML file.
- **Save Hardware Profile** is a separate action for reusable hardware recipes. It writes a YAML profile to `/config/esphomedesigner_custom_profiles/*.yaml`.
- **Generated ESPHome YAML** in the snippet box is meant to be copied into your actual ESPHome device configuration. The normal workflow is still: design in the editor, copy the generated snippet, paste/merge it into your device YAML, then compile/flash from ESPHome.
- **Import YAML back to canvas** / **Update Layout from YAML** does the reverse: it parses supported YAML back into pages/widgets and rebuilds the editor canvas for round-trip editing.
- **Show grid coordinates** by enabling **Debug Grid** in **Editor Settings** when you want an overlay with placement coordinates while arranging widgets.
- **Round-trip note**: very custom `lambda:` or `script:` code may not preview or reconstruct perfectly in the visual editor, even though the raw YAML can still be preserved.

#### 4. Local Development Server

Run the editor locally without Home Assistant:

**Option A: Full Repository Clone (with npm/bun)**

If you cloned the full repository, run from the project root:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5174` in your browser.

**Option B: Frontend-Only (Python HTTP Server)**

If you only have the `custom_components` folder (e.g., HACS install), serve the frontend directly:

```bash
cd custom_components/esphome_designer/frontend
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

Connect to Home Assistant by entering your HA URL and a Long-Lived Access Token in Editor Settings.

### Development Verification

For local feature work, the canonical verification path is:

```bash
npm test
npm run python:test
npm run quality
```

`npm test` runs the frontend suite and checks the schema hash without rewriting the committed baseline. If you intentionally changed a schema or snapshot contract, inspect it with `npm run schema:check` and then update the baseline with `npm run schema:update`.

To run the full Python panel/auth test flow locally, install the optional Python dependencies into your virtualenv once:

```bash
npm run python:deps
```

The Python helper scripts automatically prefer the repository `.venv` when it exists, then fall back to your active Python environment.

CI runs `npm run quality` on every pull request, and the protected-branch guidance in [docs/branch_protection.md](docs/branch_protection.md) should require those `test (...)` checks before merge.

For manual GitHub uploads, especially version bumps or frontend changes, run:

```bash
npm run release:prepare:skip-hassfest
```

This rebuilds the shipped frontend bundle, checks the release/version surfaces, runs the local CI-style checks, and writes `tmp/release-upload-manifest.txt` so you do not forget the full `custom_components/esphome_designer/frontend/dist` directory. If Docker is available and you want Hassfest too, use `npm run release:prepare`.

The shipped dist bundle now includes `custom_components/esphome_designer/frontend/dist/build-meta.json`. CI uses that file to verify that the current frontend sources and the active Vite asset-map-backed dist files stay in sync without false-failing on Windows-vs-Linux text normalization, checkout-only workspace drift, or leftover unreferenced hashed assets from manual browser uploads.

### Setup (ESPHome devices)

#### 5. Prepare Your Device

**Important:** Copy the Material Design Icons font file first!

From this repo: `font_ttf/font_ttf/materialdesignicons-webfont.ttf`  
To your ESPHome: `/config/esphome/fonts/materialdesignicons-webfont.ttf`

(Create the `fonts` folder if it doesn't exist)

Then create a new ESPHome device:

1. Create a new device in ESPHome Dashboard
2. Let ESPHome generate the base config (WiFi, API, OTA, etc.)
3. Configure the correct ESP platform for your device (instructions included in the generated YAML comments)

#### 6. Design Your Dashboard

1. Open the integration at `/esphome-designer` in Home Assistant
2. Select your device type (E1001, E1002, TRMNL,...)
3. Drag widgets onto the canvas
4. Add your sensors, weather entities, icons, shapes
5. Create multiple pages with different refresh rates
6. **Live Preview**: Your YAML is generated on the fly as you design! Just look at the YAML snippet box.
   <p align="center"><img src="screenshots/canvas.gif" width="800" alt="Modern Canvas Interaction"></p>

#### 7. Flash It

1. Copy the generated YAML snippet
2. Paste it below ESPHome's auto-generated sections in your device config
3. Compile and flash via ESPHome

`Save Layout` stores your editor state in Home Assistant so you can come back later. Flashing still uses the YAML in your actual ESPHome device configuration.

Done! Your custom dashboard is now running on your device.

#### 8. Connect & Automate

Once flashed, your device will come online.

1. Go to **Settings** -> **Devices & Services** in Home Assistant.
2. Your device should be discovered (or you can add it via the ESPHome integration).
3. **Configure it** to ensure Home Assistant connects to its API.

## LVGL Support (Experimental)

**Warning: Highly Experimental - Expect Bugs!**

This tool includes experimental support for **LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics Library)** widgets on LCD+Touch devices. LVGL enables interactive widgets like buttons, switches, sliders, and checkboxes that can control Home Assistant entities directly from the touchscreen.

### Important Notes

- **LCD+Touch devices only** - LVGL is designed for real-time displays, not e-paper
- **Entire page switches to LVGL mode** if you add any LVGL widget
- **High memory usage** - Requires ESP32-S3 with PSRAM
- **May be unstable** - This feature is under active development

### Available LVGL Widgets

- Buttons, Switches, Checkboxes, Sliders (interactive, can trigger HA actions)
- Arcs, Bars, Charts (display sensor values)
- Labels, Images, QR Codes, and more
- **Service Overrides** for buttons - explicitly choose `cover.open_cover`, `button.press`, etc. instead of default toggle
- **Grid Layout Mode** - assign widgets to grid cells with automatic row/column span detection

For stable results, stick to **Native Mode** (standard widgets without LVGL prefix).

---

## OpenEpaperLink & OpenDisplay

Design once, export to wireless e-paper displays:

- **[OpenEpaperLink](https://github.com/jjwbruijn/OpenEPaperLink)** - Select "OpenEpaperLink" mode, enter your tag's entity ID, copy the JSON for use in HA service calls
- **[OpenDisplay](https://github.com/open-display/open-display)** - Select "OpenDisplay" mode, copy the JSON actions, send via HTTP POST

Most widgets (text, shapes, images, icons, QR codes) work on all platforms. Graphs, touch areas, and LVGL are ESPHome-only.

---

## Features

## Technical Details

The generator produces a **complete display/application snippet** for your project. In the normal ESPHome workflow, you paste that snippet into your existing device YAML below ESPHome's auto-generated base sections.

**What it generates (everything you need):**
- **Hardware Config**: `psram`, `i2c`, `spi`, `external_components`, and device-specific sections (`m5paper`, `axp2101`)
- **Core Components**: `http_request`, `time` (Home Assistant), `globals` (page tracking), and `deep_sleep`
- **Widgets & Assets**: `font` (MDI icons), `image` (deduplicated), `online_image`, `graph`, and `qr_code`
- **HA Integration**: `sensor`, `text_sensor`, `binary_sensor`, `button`, and `switch` entities
- **Logic & Display**: `script` (smart refresh), `display` (lambda code), and `lvgl` (if enabled)

**What ESPHome provides** (auto-generated when you create a device):
- `wifi:`, `api:`, `ota:`, `logger:`

The workflow is safe and deterministic - same layout always produces the same YAML.

## Troubleshooting

**Font compilation error?**
- Make sure you copied `materialdesignicons-webfont.ttf` to `/config/esphome/fonts/`

**Display not updating?**
- Check `update_interval: never` in display config
- Verify buttons are wired to `component.update: epaper_display`


**Duplicate section errors?**
- The generator now produces a complete, standalone configuration including `psram`, `i2c`, etc.
- **Do not** use old hardware templates that define these sections. Rely on the generated code.

**Compilation Fails ("Killed signal" / Out of Memory)?**
If your Raspberry Pi crashes with `Killed signal terminated program`, it lacks the RAM for these fonts.

**Try this first:**
Add `compile_process_limit: 1` to your `esphome:` section in the YAML. This reduces memory usage but slows down compilation.

**If that fails, compile on your PC:**

1. **Install ESPHome**: Install Python, then run `pip install esphome` in your terminal.
2. **Setup Folder**: Create a folder like `C:\esphome_build` (**Important**: No spaces in the folder path!).
3. **Copy Files**: Copy your `reterminal.yaml` and the `fonts/` folder into that folder.
4. **Compile**: Run this command:
   ```powershell
   python -m esphome compile C:\esphome_build\reterminal.yaml
Upload: Take the generated .bin file and upload it via the Home Assistant ESPHome dashboard (Install -> Manual Download).

**CORS errors with GitHub-hosted version?**
Add this to your Home Assistant `configuration.yaml` and restart:
```yaml
http:
  cors_allowed_origins:
    - https://koosoli.github.io
```
