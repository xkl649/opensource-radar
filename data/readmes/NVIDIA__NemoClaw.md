# NVIDIA NemoClaw: Reference Stack for Sandboxed AI Agents in OpenShell

NVIDIA NemoClaw is an open source reference stack for running supported AI agents more safely inside [NVIDIA OpenShell](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell) sandboxes.
It provides guided onboarding, managed inference, network policy, managed integrations, snapshots, and lifecycle operations through the NemoClaw CLI and its agent-specific aliases.

**Supported agents:**

- [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) (default)
- [Hermes](https://get-hermes.ai/)
- [LangChain Deep Agents Code](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/deepagents/code/overview)

For capabilities, architecture, security controls, and the full feature list, see the [NemoClaw documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemoclaw/latest/).

## Get Started

### Start with Your Coding Agent

Use the starter prompt when you want Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, or another local coding agent to install NemoClaw with you.

**[Copy the NemoClaw starter prompt](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemoclaw/latest/user-guide/openclaw/home.html#from-your-coding-agent)**.

The prompt tells your agent to use NemoClaw docs and skills, ask one question at a time, run commands only with your approval, and keep secrets out of chat.

### Install Using the Installer in Your Terminal

Review [Prerequisites](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemoclaw/latest/get-started/prerequisites.html) before installing.
On a supported DGX or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) host, press Enter at the `Run express install with these settings? [Y/n]:` prompt to use the recommended preset settings for that platform.
Express install mode installs OpenClaw by default.
If you accept, refer to [NemoClaw Quickstart with OpenClaw](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemoclaw/latest/get-started/quickstart.html).
Enter `n` if you want to choose Hermes or LangChain Deep Agents Code, a sandbox name, an inference provider, and a model interactively.
When connecting to a Hermes sandbox from a light terminal, NemoClaw may install a managed `nemoclaw-light` Hermes skin for readable assistant text; it removes that managed skin state again when the terminal no longer needs it and preserves any user-selected Hermes skin.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development setup, coding standards, and the PR process.

Prepare a source checkout without creating a runtime sandbox:

```bash
./scripts/dev-setup.sh
```

Or ask a compatible coding agent to use the repository's contributor-onboarding skill:

> Set up this machine as a NemoClaw contributor and prepare it for a first PR.

The contributor path is separate from the end-user installer above.
The default and `--repair` modes change only repository-local dependencies, builds, and hooks.
Use `./scripts/dev-setup.sh --expose-cli` only when you explicitly want a host-visible development CLI.
Use `./scripts/dev-setup.sh --with-runtime` only when your change needs sandbox validation; that approved flow also opts into CLI exposure.

## Security

NVIDIA takes security seriously.
If you discover a vulnerability in NemoClaw, **DO NOT open a public issue.**
Use one of the private reporting channels described in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md):

- Submit a report through the [NVIDIA Vulnerability Disclosure Program](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/security/report-vulnerability/).
- Send an email to [psirt@nvidia.com](mailto:psirt@nvidia.com) encrypted with the [NVIDIA PGP key](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/security/pgp-key).
- Use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/how-tos/report-and-fix-vulnerabilities/configure-vulnerability-reporting/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-a-repository) to submit a report directly on this repository.

For security bulletins and PSIRT policies, visit the [NVIDIA Product Security](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/security/) portal.

## Current Priorities

NemoClaw's current priorities are maintained here as a public orientation point for contributors and community members.
This list is not a delivery commitment, support promise, or fixed roadmap; priorities can change as maintainers respond to security, quality, platform readiness, and community feedback.

- Improve install and onboarding reliability across tested platforms.
- Strengthen sandbox hardening, credential handling, and network-policy defaults.
- Validate local and routed inference behavior for supported provider paths.
- Keep documentation, troubleshooting guidance, and agent skills aligned with supported workflows.

For specific scoped work, use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw/issues) and start broader proposals in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw/discussions).
Security vulnerabilities must use the private reporting channels in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), not public issues.
