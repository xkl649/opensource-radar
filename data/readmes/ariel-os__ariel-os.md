Ariel OS is an operating system for secure, memory-safe, low-power Internet of Things (IoT).
It is based on Rust from the ground up
and [supports hardware](https://ariel-os.github.io/ariel-os/dev/docs/book/hardware-functionality-support.html)
based on 32-bit microcontroller architectures (Cortex-M, RISC-V, and Xtensa).
For a quick overview of our motivations and what we plan next, check our [roadmap](https://github.com/ariel-os/ariel-os/blob/main/ROADMAP.md).

## Goals and Design

Ariel OS builds on top of existing projects from the Embedded Rust ecosystem, including [Embassy](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy), [esp-hal](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal), [defmt](https://github.com/knurling-rs/defmt), [probe-rs](https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs), [sequential-storage](https://github.com/tweedegolf/sequential-storage), and [embedded-test](https://github.com/probe-rs/embedded-test).
While those provide high-quality building blocks for a wide range of embedded applications, such projects do not provide the high level of integration that developers know from contemporary C-based operating systems for microcontrollers, such as [RIOT](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/) or [Zephyr](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr) for instance.

Ariel OS thus follows an approach whereby it simultaneously integrates many heterogeneous pre-existing crates, and adds missing operating system functionalities such as a preemptive multicore scheduler, portable peripheral APIs, additional network security facilities, as well as [laze](https://github.com/kaspar030/laze), a meta-build system to bind it all together.
The result?
A powerful framework that allows to write portable embedded Rust applications with minimal boilerplate, providing a batteries-included experience.
