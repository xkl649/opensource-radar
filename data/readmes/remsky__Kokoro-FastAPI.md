### Voices

<details>
<summary>Voice Combination</summary>

- Weighted voice combinations using ratios (e.g., "af_bella(2)+af_heart(1)" for 67%/33% mix)
- Ratios are automatically normalized to sum to 100%
- Available through any endpoint by adding weights in parentheses
- Saves generated voicepacks for future use

Combine voices and generate audio:
```python
import requests
response = requests.get("http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/voices")
voices = [v["id"] for v in response.json()["voices"]]

# Weighted voice combination (67%/33% mix)
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/speech",
    json={
        "input": "Hello world!",
        "voice": "af_bella(2)+af_sky(1)",  # 2:1 ratio = 67%/33%
        "response_format": "mp3"
    }
)

# Download combined voice as .pt file
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/voices/combine",
    json="af_bella(2)+af_sky(1)"  # 2:1 ratio = 67%/33%
)

# Save the .pt file
with open("combined_voice.pt", "wb") as f:
    f.write(response.content)

# Use the downloaded voice file
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/speech",
    json={
        "input": "Hello world!",
        "voice": "combined_voice",  # Use the saved voice file
        "response_format": "mp3"
    }
)

```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Voice Aliases</summary>

Weighted mixes can get long fast. `voice_aliases` maps a short name per request, for both the `voice` field and `[voice:...]` tags:
- Aliases prefer to match case-insensitively (keep lowercase to avoid inconsistencies). 
- An alias pointing at a nonexistent voice returns a 400.
- The web UI's cast exports in the same format e.g. `{"voice_aliases": {...}}`; interchangeable for API calls.


```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8880/v1", api_key="not-needed")

client.audio.speech.create(
    model="kokoro",
    voice="narrator",
    input="[voice:narrator] Once upon a time. [voice:villain] Never!",
    extra_body={
        "allow_voice_tags": True,
        "voice_aliases": {"narrator": "af_bella(2)+af_sky", "villain": "am_michael"},
    },
)
```

or

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "kokoro",
    "voice": "narrator",
    "input": "[voice:narrator] Once upon a time. [voice:villain] Never!",
    "allow_voice_tags": true,
    "voice_aliases": {"narrator": "af_bella(2)+af_sky", "villain": "am_michael"},
    "response_format": "mp3"
  }' --output aliased.mp3
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Multi-Speaker / Dialogue</summary>

- `[voice:...]` tags switch speakers inline, anywhere `input` is accepted
- `/v1/audio/speech` needs `allow_voice_tags: true` per request; `/dev/dialogue` allows them by default
- `ENABLE_VOICE_TAGS=false` opts out server-wide: the parameter is refused and `/dev/dialogue` 403s

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "kokoro",
    "voice": "af_heart",
    "input": "The narrator opens. [voice:af_bella] Did it land? [pause:0.3s] [voice:am_michael] It did.",
    "allow_voice_tags": true,
    "response_format": "mp3"
  }' --output dialogue.mp3
```

With the official OpenAI client, pass the param in `extra_body`:

```python
client.audio.speech.create(
    model="kokoro",
    voice="af_jadzia",
    input="The narrator opens. [voice:af_bella] Did it land?",
    extra_body={"allow_voice_tags": True},
)
```

`POST /dev/dialogue` uses structured turns, and allows `pause_between_turns` to be controlled by param. 

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8880/dev/dialogue \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "turns": [
      {"voice": "af_bella", "text": "Did the multi speaker support land?"},
      {"voice": "am_michael", "text": "It did. Turns switch voices inline."}
    ],
    "pause_between_turns": 0.4,
    "response_format": "mp3"
  }' --output dialogue.mp3
```

Notes:
- Any text before the first tag uses the request's `voice`/default. 
- Each speaker keeps its own language pipeline based on voice prefix. An explicit `lang_code` will override every speaker.
- Consecutive turns sharing a voice are merged automatically.
- Tags accept short names from **Voice Aliases** above, instead of full weighted mixes.

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/gpu_dialogue_turn_length.png" width="45%" alt="Throughput against the single-voice baseline as speaker turns get shorter" style="border: 2px solid #333; padding: 10px; margin-right: 1%;">
  <img src="assets/gpu_dialogue_text_length.png" width="45%" alt="Throughput at two voice change rates as the generation grows" style="border: 2px solid #333; padding: 10px;">
</div>

Number of voices has minimal impact on generation speed. For continuous swaps though, if each speaker gets less than about 2 sentences, chunking requirements slow generation down. Still a flat cost, not compounding as the text grows. Regenerate with `examples/assorted_checks/test_dialogue/`.
</details>

### Text Control

<details>
<summary>Inline Control Tokens</summary>

Four tokens can be embedded in the `input` text and are parsed server-side (API, WebUI, or any client):

- **Pause**: `[pause:1.5s]` inserts that much silence. Must be exactly this form (colon, trailing `s`, case-insensitive). `[pause=1.5]` and `[PAUSE 1.0]` are not recognized and get read aloud.
- **Pronunciation**: `[Worcester](/wˈʊstər/)` speaks the IPA between the slashes instead of the word. English only; use `/dev/phonemize` to find the IPA.
- **Voice**: `[voice:am_michael]` switches speaker for everything that follows.
  - Requires `allow_voice_tags: true` per request, and `ENABLE_VOICE_TAGS` server-side (on by default). Otherwise the tag is spoken as written.
  - Accepts the same combine syntax as the `voice` parameter (`[voice:af_bella(2)+af_sky]`), 
  - Short names/aliases can be defined in `voice_aliases`, 
  - Unknown values return a 400.
- **Rate**: `[rate:1.5]` scales the speaking voice's pace until the next rate tag or voice change; `[rate:1.0]` reverts. Applies on top of the request `speed`, clamped to 0.25-4.0. Same gating as voice tags.
  - A voice alias can carry a natural pace: `{"grandpa": {"voice": "am_michael", "rate": 0.8}}` applies that rate whenever the alias speaks, as the `voice` parameter or in tags. Useful for voices that read fast or slow, and for named presets over one voice (`narrator_fast`, `narrator_slow`).
  - Rate belongs to the voice speaking it. A `[rate:]` tag scales the speaker's calibrated pace rather than replacing it, so an alias throttled to `0.8` stays proportionally slower under `[rate:1.1]`. Every `[voice:...]` tag resets to the new voice's own rate, so a calibrated speaker cannot drag its pace onto the next one. Use `speed` for a pace over the whole request.

```text
The city of [Worcester](/wˈʊstər/) is easy. [pause:1s] See?
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>SSML Input (experimental)</summary>

Send `ssml: true` with `allow_voice_tags: true` on `/v1/audio/speech` or `/dev/captioned_speech` to translate and speak in one call. Both flags are needed, since the translation emits `[voice:]` and `[rate:]` spans that would otherwise be read aloud; `ssml` without them is a 400.

```json
{
  "model": "kokoro",
  "input": "<speak>Hi<break time=\"750ms\"/>there</speak>",
  "voice": "af_bella",
  "allow_voice_tags": true,
  "ssml": true
}
```

`POST /dev/ssml` does the translation on its own when you want the tokens back as text rather than audio, or want to inspect them before synthesis. Send `text`, plus `voice` if your speech request uses one, then pass the result back with `allow_voice_tags: true`. Without a voice, `<voice>`/`<prosody>` are stripped and their content kept.

- `<break time="750ms"/>` becomes `[pause:0.75s]`. `strength=` instead of `time=` gives none/x-weak 0s, weak 0.25s, medium 0.5s, strong 1s, x-strong 1.5s
- `<voice name="am_michael">` becomes `[voice:am_michael]`, reverts at the closing tag
- `<prosody rate="slow">` becomes `[rate:0.75]`, and takes `80%` or `1.2` too. Scales the speaking voice's pace on top of the request `speed`, clamped 0.25-4.0, reverts. `pitch`/`volume` ignored
- `<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="wˈʊstər">Worcester</phoneme>` becomes `[Worcester](/wˈʊstər/)`, IPA and English only
- `<sub alias="World Wide Web">WWW</sub>` speaks the alias
- `<desc>` is dropped with its text, an audio description is not speech
- `<emphasis>`, `<say-as>`, `<p>`, `<s>`, `<lang>`, etc: markup dropped, text spoken
- Malformed SSML is a 400, non-SSML passes through unchanged
- DTDs are refused and nesting past `SSML_MAX_DEPTH` (10) is a 400; no dialect uses a DTD, real documents nest 2-5
- Prefixed names (`google:style`, `mstts:express-as`, `amazon:effect`) need their `xmlns:` on `<speak>`, vendor docs often omit it
- `GET /dev/ssml` serves these tables as data, read off the translator itself

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8880/dev/ssml -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "<speak>The city of <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"wˈʊstər\">Worcester</phoneme> is easy.<break time=\"1s\"/>See?</speak>"}'
# {"text": "The city of [Worcester](/wˈʊstər/) is easy. [pause:1.0s] See?"}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Natural Boundary Detection</summary>

- Automatically splits and stitches at sentence boundaries 
- Reduces artifacts, and allows long-form output from a base model configured for roughly 30s at a time

The model takes up to 510 phonemized tokens per chunk, but running it that long tends to produce 'rushed' speech and other artifacts. The server adds its own chunking layer on top, sized by `TARGET_MIN_TOKENS`, `TARGET_MAX_TOKENS`, and `ABSOLUTE_MAX_TOKENS` (175, 250, 450 by default, set via environment variables).

    "http://localhost:8880/dev/captioned_speech",
    json={
        "model": "kokoro",
        "input": "Hello world!",
        "voice": "af_bella",
        "speed": 1.0,
        "response_format": "mp3",
        "stream": False,
    },
    stream=False
)

with open("output.mp3","wb") as f:

    audio_json=json.loads(response.content)
    chunk_audio=base64.b64decode(audio_json["audio"].encode("utf-8"))
    f.write(chunk_audio)
    print(audio_json["timestamps"])
```

Generate audio with word-level timestamps with streaming:
```python
import requests
import base64
import json

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8880/dev/captioned_speech",
    json={
        "model": "kokoro",
        "input": "Hello world!",
        "voice": "af_bella",
        "speed": 1.0,
        "response_format": "mp3",
        "stream": True,
    },
    stream=True
)

f=open("output.mp3","wb")
for chunk in response.iter_lines(decode_unicode=True):
    if chunk:
        chunk_json=json.loads(chunk)
        chunk_audio=base64.b64decode(chunk_json["audio"].encode("utf-8"))
        f.write(chunk_audio)
        print(chunk_json["timestamps"])
```

With `"allow_voice_tags": true`, each timestamp also carries the `voice` that spoke the word, so multi-speaker captions can be labelled without re-deriving the split client side. Without it the field is absent.

<details>
<summary>Timestamps (streaming chunks)</summary>

With `stream`, `return_download_link`, and `return_timing` set, the response carries an `X-Timing-Path` header pointing at a JSON sidecar of per-chunk timings. The audio body is unchanged and nothing extra is computed; this is what drives the web UI's read along.

```python
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/speech",
    json={
        "input": "Hello world! [pause:1s] Again.",
        "voice": "af_bella",
        "stream": True,
        "return_download_link": True,
        "return_timing": True,
    },
    stream=True,
)
audio = b"".join(response.iter_content(1024))

timings = requests.get(f"http://localhost:8880/v1{response.headers['x-timing-path']}").json()
# {"chunks": [{"text": "Hello world!", "start": 0.0, "end": 0.64}, ...]}
```

- Chunk-level (a sentence group, roughly 10-20s of audio), not word-level. For word-level use `/dev/captioned_speech`.
- The header arrives up front, but the file is written when generation finishes. Fetch it after the stream ends; earlier is a 404.
- `start`/`end` are seconds in the final audio, so pauses and speed are already accounted for. `[pause:Ns]` gaps appear as `{"text": ""}` entries.
- `text` is normalized (numbers etc expanded), so align by words rather than exact match.
- With `allow_voice_tags`, each spoken chunk also carries its `voice`, same as captioned timestamps. Absent otherwise.
- The sidecar sits next to the download file and shares its temp lifetime.

## Performance & Operations

<details>
<summary>Performance & Benchmarks</summary>

### Throughput

Generation through the local API, text lengths up to feature-length books (~1.5 hours output), measuring processing time and realtime factor. Run on:
- Windows 11 Home w/ WSL2
- NVIDIA 4060Ti 16gb GPU @ CUDA 12.1
- 11th Gen i7-11700 @ 2.5GHz
- 64gb RAM
- WAV native output
- H.G. Wells - The Time Machine (full text)

  <img src="assets/gpu_realtime_factor.png" width="45%" alt="Realtime Factor" style="border: 2px solid #333; padding: 10px;">
</p>

Key Performance Metrics:
- Realtime Speed: Ranges between 35x-100x (generation time to output audio length)
- Average Processing Rate: 137.67 tokens/second (cl100k_base)

### Model Unload / VRAM Reclaim

`POST /dev/unload` frees the model from VRAM and reloads lazily on the next request. Reclaim scales with load (the activation pool, not just weights) but plateaus: chunks cap at 450 tokens. Long-form = ~30 paragraphs. Same setup as above.

</p>

| Workload | Loaded | Floor | Reclaimed | Reload |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Short (6s audio) | 3.11 GB | 2.37 GB | 758 MiB | +4.9s |
| Long-form (7.5m) | 3.98 GB | 2.37 GB | 1,656 MiB | +5.1s |

Floor is host + CUDA context. Reproduce with `uv run --extra benchmarks assorted_checks/benchmarks/benchmark_model_unload.py` from `examples/`.

### Transcription roundtrip (WER/CER)

End-to-end roundtrip: synthesize with Kokoro, transcribe the result back with [`faster-whisper`](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper), compare to the source text. Scripts and data live under `examples/assorted_checks/test_transcription/`.

**Long-form English** (full book, *A Journey to the Centre of the Earth*, Project Gutenberg, voice `af_heart`, `base.en` Whisper on CUDA float16, baseline captured on cu126 GPU build):

| Run | Input chars | Audio length | Synth speedup | Transcribe speedup | WER |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Short (~ch.7) | 64,996 | 66m 06s | 36.4x rt | 62.4x rt | **0.047** |
| Full book | 502,766 | 507m 52s | 45.7x rt | 65.1x rt | **0.033** |

See `examples/assorted_checks/test_transcription/BASELINE.md` for the full regression bands.

**Per-language check** (single-sentence per voice, multilingual Whisper `small`. WER for Latin scripts, CER for ja/zh/hi):

| Language | Voice | Metric | Score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| English | `af_heart` | WER | 0.000 |
| English (UK) | `bf_emma` | WER | 0.111 |
| Spanish | `ef_dora` | WER | 0.000 |
| French | `ff_siwis` | WER | 0.000 |
| Italian | `if_sara` | WER | 0.000 |
| Portuguese | `pf_dora` | WER | 0.000 |
| Hindi | `hf_alpha` | CER | 0.059 |
| Japanese | `jf_alpha` | CER | 0.000 |
| Chinese | `zf_xiaobei` | CER | 0.143 |

*Caveat: these are single short sentences, not a comprehensive per-language quality benchmark. They confirm each voice produces transcribable audio in its target language; deeper quality evaluation per language is open work.*

To reproduce, see `examples/assorted_checks/test_transcription/README.md`.

<summary>Configuration Variables</summary>

Every setting is an environment variable, or a line in a `.env` file at the project root. Full reference in [the configuration guide](docs/configuration.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Debug Endpoints</summary>

System state and resource usage, for debugging exhaustion or performance issues. The `/debug/*` routes expose host and process internals, so they are off by default; set `ENABLE_DEBUG_ENDPOINTS=true` to enable.

- `/debug/threads` - Get thread information and stack traces
- `/debug/storage` - Disk usage per mounted partition
- `/debug/system` - Get system information (CPU, memory, GPU)
- `POST /dev/unload` - Release model from VRAM; reloads lazily on next request. Off by default; set `ALLOW_DEV_UNLOAD=true` to enable

Stability: the `/v1/*` OpenAI-compatible routes are the stable API. `/dev/*` and `/debug/*` are operational helpers, and may change or move behind flags between minor releases.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Logging</summary>

Global API [loguru logging level](https://loguru.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/logger.html#levels) can be set using the `API_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable. Defaults to `DEBUG`. Per run method in [the configuration guide](docs/configuration.md#logging).
</details>

## Known Issues & Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>Missing words & Missing some timestamps</summary>

The API normalizes input text, which can incorrectly remove or change some phrases. Disable it with `"normalization_options":{"normalize": false}` in the request json:
```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/speech",
    json={
        "input": "Hello world!",
        "voice": "af_heart",
        "response_format": "pcm",
        "normalization_options":
        {
            "normalize": False
        }
    },
    stream=True
)

for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=1024):
    if chunk:
        # Process streaming chunks
        pass
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>WAV duration reported as nonsense in some readers</summary>

WAV responses use a streaming-sentinel (`0xFFFFFFFF`) for the size fields in the header. Most readers handle this fine: `soundfile`, `pydub`/ffmpeg, browsers, OS players. Python's stdlib `wave` does not, and reports a bogus duration. For exact length use `soundfile.info(path).duration` or `ffprobe`.

## Project

<details>
<summary>Versioning & Development</summary>

**Branching Strategy:**
*   **`release` branch:** Contains the latest stable build, recommended for production use. Docker images tagged with specific versions are built from this branch.
*   **`master` branch:** Active development. Experimental features, ongoing changes, and fixes not yet released. Use it for the newest code, expect less stability. No images are published from here; `:latest` is built from `release` like every other tag.

Note: This is a *development* focused project at its core.

If you run into trouble, you may have to roll back a version on the release tags if something comes up, or build up from source and/or troubleshoot + submit a PR.

Free and open source is a community effort, and there's only really so many hours in a day. If you'd like to support the work, feel free to open a PR, buy me a coffee, or report any bugs/features/etc you find during use.
