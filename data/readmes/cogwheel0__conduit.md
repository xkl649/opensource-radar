Open WebUI is excellent on the desktop. On mobile it breaks down at the edges:
authentication behind a reverse proxy, streaming that drops when the app
backgrounds, getting a screenshot into a prompt, starting a chat from the home
screen. Conduit is a real Flutter app built to close that gap, and as of 4.0 it
works with or without an Open WebUI server at all.

Your chats live on your device first. Nothing routes through a backend the
maintainer operates.

## Three ways to connect

On first launch Conduit asks how you want to connect. Pick one, add the others
later, and skip any sign-in you don't need.

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Open WebUI** | Your self-hosted server | Full feature set: chats, folders, notes, channels, workspace, tools, web search, image generation |
| **Direct** | OpenAI-compatible, Ollama, OpenRouter | Talk straight to a provider or a model on your own machine. No Open WebUI account required |
| **Hermes** | Your self-hosted agent | An agent that runs tools, asks before sensitive steps, and works on a schedule |

**Direct connections** cover OpenAI-compatible endpoints (Chat Completions or
Responses), LM Studio, Azure-style API versions, native Ollama, and first-party
OpenRouter. Bring an API key, or skip it for a local endpoint that doesn't want
one. Direct connections you already configured in Open WebUI come along
automatically. Keys and custom headers stay in platform secure storage.

**Hermes Agent** connects to your own Hermes server. You watch its tools work
live, approve sensitive steps before they run, and let scheduled agents run
while you sleep. Conversations and schedules get their own tab, and Conduit only
exposes the capabilities your server actually reports.

## Screenshots

| Chat | Connect | Chats | Voice |

## What you get

### Chat that survives mobile

Token-by-token streaming over WebSocket. The transcript holds its place while a
response grows, pinned prompts stay put, and long conversations load without
stalling the UI. Search across conversations, organize with folders, pin what
matters, or start a temporary chat that leaves nothing behind.

### Rendering that holds up on a phone

Native Flutter surfaces, not a web view wrapped in a shell:

- syntax-highlighted code blocks with copy and preview
- Mermaid diagrams rendered natively
- LaTeX and math
- expandable reasoning, tool-call, and code-execution sections
- inline citations, source cards, and follow-up suggestions
- Chart.js embeds

### A real Workspace

Models, knowledge, prompts, tools, and skills as native screens with unified
settings navigation. Sections you don't have permission for simply don't appear.

### Everything else

| Area | What's included |
| --- | --- |
| Files and media | Uploads, re-attaching previously uploaded server files, multimodal prompts, clipboard image paste, audio attachments |
| Notes | Autosave, pinning, AI-generated titles, AI enhancement, audio recording, all available offline |
| Channels | Threads and reactions, when your server enables them |
| Voice | Voice input with on-device or server speech recognition, plus a full voice-call mode |
| Home screen | Widgets on iOS and Android for new chat, mic, camera, photos, and clipboard; app quick actions; iOS App Intents and Shortcuts |
| Sharing | Share-sheet ingestion from other apps straight into a prompt |
| Terminal | Interactive sessions over WebSocket with a file browser, shown only when your server exposes it |
| Personalization | Light, dark, and system themes; five accent palettes; adaptive Material and Cupertino UI; haptics |
| Languages | 14 locales: English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Dutch, Russian, Simplified and Traditional Chinese, Czech, Slovak, Polish |

Server-dependent features (channels, notes, web search, image generation,
toggle filters, terminal) appear only when your deployment exposes them.

## Built for self-hosted reality

Most mobile clients assume a plain login form. Real deployments rarely look like
that.

- **Every auth path Open WebUI offers**: username and password, LDAP, manual JWT
  entry, SSO and OAuth providers.
- **Reverse proxies actually work**: `oauth2-proxy`, Authelia, Authentik,
  Pangolin, and Cloudflare Tunnel, by capturing the right cookies and session
  state on-device.
- **Custom headers during setup** for environments that require `X-API-Key`,
  `Authorization`, or organization routing headers.
- **Credentials in Keychain or Keystore**, never plain-text local storage.
- **Tracks upstream**: Conduit supports Open WebUI 0.11.

## Getting started

Install from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/conduit-open-webui-client/id6749840287)
or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.cogwheel.conduit),
then pick how you want to connect.

<details open>
<summary><strong>Open WebUI</strong></summary>

1. Launch Conduit and choose Open WebUI.
2. Enter your instance's base URL.
3. Add any required custom headers.
4. Sign in with username and password, LDAP, JWT, SSO, or proxy auth.
5. Pick a model and start chatting.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Direct connection</strong></summary>

1. Launch Conduit and choose Direct connection.
2. Add an OpenAI-compatible or Ollama profile with its base URL and any API key
   or custom headers.
3. Test the connection, enable it, and select a discovered or manually entered
   model.
4. Choose whether new direct chats use Open WebUI history when one is signed in,
   or stay only on this device. Existing chats keep their current location.
5. Start chatting. No Open WebUI account required.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Hermes Agent</strong></summary>

1. Launch Conduit and choose Hermes Agent.
2. Enter your Hermes server URL and `API_SERVER_KEY`.
3. Optionally set a memory key to scope the agent's long-term memory to you. One
   is generated automatically on first chat if you leave it blank.
4. Open the Hermes tab for conversations and scheduled agents.

</details>

## Privacy

- Chats, notes, and drafts are stored on your device. Notes and drafts stay
  available without a connection.
- Credentials use platform secure storage: Keychain on iOS, Keystore on
  Android.
- No third-party analytics or advertising SDKs.
- Diagnostic logging is local and transient.
- No developer-operated backend relays your data. Traffic goes from your device
  to the server or provider you configured, and nowhere else.
- Signing out lets you choose what stays behind. Clearing everything clears
  on-device chats too, and fails safely rather than half-deleting.

## Build from source

See **[docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md)** for requirements, submodules,
codegen, verification, project layout, and troubleshooting.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/cogwheel0/conduit.git
cd conduit
flutter pub get
dart run build_runner build
flutter run -d ios   # or: flutter run -d android
```

Clone recursively and run `build_runner`. The Mermaid renderer is a submodule,
and generated Dart files are git-ignored.

## Contributing

Conduit is actively developed and feedback is welcome.

- Bugs → [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/cogwheel0/conduit/issues)
- Features, deployment notes, questions →
  [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/cogwheel0/conduit/discussions)

Unsolicited pull requests are not the primary contribution path right now. Open
an issue or discussion first so changes line up with the roadmap.

## Enterprise and white-label
