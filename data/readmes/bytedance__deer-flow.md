> On February 28th, 2026, DeerFlow claimed the 🏆 #1 spot on GitHub Trending following the launch of version 2. Thanks a million to our incredible community — you made this happen! 💪🔥

DeerFlow (**D**eep **E**xploration and **E**fficient **R**esearch **Flow**) is an open-source **super agent harness** that orchestrates **sub-agents**, **memory**, and **sandboxes** to do almost anything — powered by **extensible skills**.

> [!NOTE]
> **DeerFlow 2.0 is a ground-up rewrite.** It shares no code with v1. If you're looking for the original Deep Research framework, it's maintained on the [`1.x` branch](https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow/tree/main-1.x) — contributions there are still welcome. Active development has moved to 2.0.

## One-Line Agent Setup

If you use Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, or another coding agent, you can hand it the setup instructions in one sentence:

```text
Help me clone DeerFlow if needed, then bootstrap it for local development by following https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bytedance/deer-flow/main/Install.md
```

That prompt is intended for coding agents. It tells the agent to clone the repo if needed, choose Docker when available, and stop with the exact next command plus any missing config the user still needs to provide.

## Quick Start

### Configuration

1. **Clone the DeerFlow repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow.git
   cd deer-flow
   ```

2. **Run the setup wizard**

   From the project root directory (`deer-flow/`), run:

   ```bash
   make setup
   ```

   This launches an interactive wizard that guides you through choosing an LLM provider, optional web search, and execution/safety preferences such as sandbox mode, bash access, and file-write tools. It generates a minimal `config.yaml` and writes your keys to `.env`. Takes about 2 minutes.

   The wizard also lets you configure an optional web search provider, or skip it for now.

   Run `make doctor` at any time to verify your setup and get actionable fix hints.
   If you are opening a GitHub issue about a local setup or runtime problem, run
   `make support-bundle`. The command prints reporter next steps, writes a
   `*-issue-summary.md` file to paste into the issue, a `*-issue-draft.md` file
   for AI-assisted issue filing, and an optional evidence zip under
   `.deer-flow/support-bundles/`. If an AI assistant files the issue, start from
   the draft and replace every REQUIRED placeholder instead of inventing missing
   facts. Attach the zip only if a maintainer asks for it, or if the summary
   alone is not enough. Maintainers and AI triage tools can start with
   `triage.json`; the bundle includes redacted diagnostics and file manifests
   only, and does not include `.env`, raw conversation messages, or user file
   contents.

   > **Advanced / manual configuration**: If you prefer to edit `config.yaml` directly, run `make config` instead to copy the full template. See `config.example.yaml` for the complete reference including CLI-backed providers (Codex CLI, Claude Code OAuth), OpenRouter, Responses API, subagent runtime caps such as `subagents.max_total_per_run`, and more.

   Optional per-model pricing must use one currency across all priced models.
   DeerFlow disables Console cost estimates when currencies are mixed rather
   than presenting an invalid aggregate.

   <details>
   <summary>Manual model configuration examples</summary>

   ```yaml
   models:
     - name: gpt-4o
       display_name: GPT-4o
       use: langchain_openai:ChatOpenAI
       model: gpt-4o
       api_key: $OPENAI_API_KEY

     - name: openrouter-gemini-2.5-flash
       display_name: Gemini 2.5 Flash (OpenRouter)
       use: langchain_openai:ChatOpenAI
       model: google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview
       api_key: $OPENROUTER_API_KEY
       base_url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1

     - name: gpt-5-responses
       display_name: GPT-5 (Responses API)
       use: langchain_openai:ChatOpenAI
       model: gpt-5
       api_key: $OPENAI_API_KEY
       use_responses_api: true
       output_version: responses/v1

     - name: qwen3-32b-vllm
       display_name: Qwen3 32B (vLLM)
       use: deerflow.models.vllm_provider:VllmChatModel
       model: Qwen/Qwen3-32B
       api_key: $VLLM_API_KEY
       base_url: http://localhost:8000/v1
       supports_thinking: true
       when_thinking_enabled:
         extra_body:
           chat_template_kwargs:
             enable_thinking: true
   ```

   OpenRouter and similar OpenAI-compatible gateways should be configured with `langchain_openai:ChatOpenAI` plus `base_url`. If you prefer a provider-specific environment variable name, point `api_key` at that variable explicitly (for example `api_key: $OPENROUTER_API_KEY`).

   To route OpenAI models through `/v1/responses`, keep using `langchain_openai:ChatOpenAI` and set `use_responses_api: true` with `output_version: responses/v1`.

   For vLLM 0.19.0, use `deerflow.models.vllm_provider:VllmChatModel`. For Qwen-style reasoning models, DeerFlow toggles reasoning with `extra_body.chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking` and preserves vLLM's non-standard `reasoning` field across multi-turn tool-call conversations. Legacy `thinking` configs are normalized automatically for backward compatibility. If the endpoint reports a cumulative usage snapshot on every streaming chunk, set `cumulative_stream_usage: true` so DeerFlow converts those snapshots into per-chunk deltas; the option is disabled by default and leaves usage unchanged when a stable completion id is unavailable. Reasoning models may also require the server to be started with `--reasoning-parser ...`. If your local vLLM deployment accepts any non-empty API key, you can still set `VLLM_API_KEY` to a placeholder value.

   CLI-backed provider examples:

   ```yaml
   models:
     - name: gpt-5.4
       display_name: GPT-5.4 (Codex CLI)
       use: deerflow.models.openai_codex_provider:CodexChatModel
       model: gpt-5.4
       supports_thinking: true
       supports_reasoning_effort: true

     - name: claude-sonnet-4.6
       display_name: Claude Sonnet 4.6 (Claude Code OAuth)
       use: deerflow.models.claude_provider:ClaudeChatModel
       model: claude-sonnet-4-6
       max_tokens: 4096
       supports_thinking: true
   ```

   - Codex CLI reads `~/.codex/auth.json`
   - Claude Code accepts `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `CLAUDE_CODE_CREDENTIALS_PATH`, or `~/.claude/.credentials.json`
   - ACP agent entries are separate from model providers — if you configure `acp_agents.codex`, point it at a Codex ACP adapter such as `npx -y @zed-industries/codex-acp`
   - MiniMax Code speaks ACP directly. Install and authenticate it, then add it as an ACP agent:

   ```bash
   npm install --global @minimax-ai/code
   mcode login
   ```

   ```yaml
   acp_agents:
     mcode:
       command: mcode
       args: ["acp"]
       description: MiniMax Code for implementation, refactoring, debugging, and repository tasks
       auto_approve_permissions: false
   ```

   `mcode` must be on the Gateway process's `PATH`; installing it only on the Docker host does not make it available inside the Gateway container. DeerFlow invokes it through `invoke_acp_agent` in a per-thread ACP workspace and forwards enabled MCP servers. Keep `auto_approve_permissions: false` for untrusted tasks; enable it only when MCode must edit files or run commands and you trust the task.
   - On macOS, export Claude Code auth explicitly if needed:

   ```bash
   eval "$(python3 scripts/export_claude_code_oauth.py --print-export)"
   ```

   API keys can also be set manually in `.env` (recommended) or exported in your shell:

   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   TAVILY_API_KEY=your-tavily-api-key
   ```

   </details>

### Running the Application

#### Deployment Sizing

Use the table below as a practical starting point when choosing how to run DeerFlow:

| Deployment target | Starting point | Recommended | Notes |
|---------|-----------|------------|-------|
| Local evaluation / `make dev` | 4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM, 20 GB free SSD | 8 vCPU, 16 GB RAM | Good for one developer or one light session with hosted model APIs. `2 vCPU / 4 GB` is usually not enough. |
| Docker development / `make docker-start` | 4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM, 25 GB free SSD | 8 vCPU, 16 GB RAM | Image builds, bind mounts, and sandbox containers need more headroom than pure local dev. |
| Long-running server / `make up` | 8 vCPU, 16 GB RAM, 40 GB free SSD | 16 vCPU, 32 GB RAM | Preferred for shared use, multi-agent runs, report generation, or heavier sandbox workloads. |

- These numbers cover DeerFlow itself. If you also host a local LLM, size that service separately.
- Linux plus Docker is the recommended deployment target for a persistent server. macOS and Windows are best treated as development or evaluation environments.
- If CPU or memory usage stays pinned, reduce concurrent runs first, then move to the next sizing tier.

#### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

**Development** (hot-reload, source mounts):

```bash
make docker-init    # Pull sandbox image (only once or when image updates)
make docker-start   # Start services (auto-detects sandbox mode from config.yaml)
make docker-logs    # View logs
```

`make docker-start` starts `provisioner` only when `config.yaml` uses provisioner mode (`sandbox.use: deerflow.community.aio_sandbox:AioSandboxProvider` with `provisioner_url`).

Docker builds use the upstream `uv` registry by default. If you need faster mirrors in restricted networks, export `UV_INDEX_URL=https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple` and `NPM_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmmirror.com` before running `make docker-init` or `make docker-start`.

Local AIO sandbox control traffic is always direct: loopback/private addresses,
single-label cluster hosts, and Docker/Podman internal hostnames do not inherit
`HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY`. External sandbox FQDNs and public IPs still
honor environment proxy settings.

Backend processes automatically pick up `config.yaml` changes on the next config access, so model metadata updates do not require a manual restart during development.
The checkpoint storage settings `database.checkpoint_channel_mode` and
`database.checkpoint_delta.snapshot_frequency` (default `10`) are exceptions:
both are frozen when the process first builds an agent (including through
`DeerFlowClient`) and require a process restart to change safely.

The optional `database.checkpoint_cache` section (delta channel mode only)
caches materialized checkpoint histories: `type` is `memory` (default) or
`redis`, and `max_entries: 0` disables the cache. The `redis` backend is
Gateway/async-only; the sync TUI/embedded path supports `memory` only. The
cache is performance-only — results are identical with it disabled — so it is
never frozen and workers sharing one checkpoint database may safely run
different cache settings.

> [!TIP]
> On Linux, if Docker-based commands fail with `permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock`, add your user to the `docker` group and re-login before retrying. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#linux-docker-daemon-permission-denied) for the full fix.

**Production** (builds images locally, mounts runtime config and data):

```bash
make up     # Build images and start all production services
make down   # Stop and remove containers
```

Access: http://localhost:2026

`make up` waits for the Gateway `/health` endpoint before reporting success.
If the Gateway does not become healthy within the startup window, deployment
exits non-zero and prints the container status plus recent Gateway logs. The
production image starts from its already-built environment and never resolves
or installs Python dependencies at container startup.

For persistent deployments, configure `database.backend` as `sqlite` or
`postgres`. The selected backend is shared by the LangGraph checkpointer,
LangGraph Store, and DeerFlow application data. The deprecated `checkpointer`
section, when present, overrides the first two for backward compatibility.

The unified nginx endpoint is same-origin by default and does not emit browser CORS headers. If you run a split-origin or port-forwarded browser client, set `GATEWAY_CORS_ORIGINS` to comma-separated exact origins such as `http://localhost:3000`; the Gateway then applies the CORS allowlist and matching CSRF origin checks.

Browser login uses `HttpOnly` session cookies. The login page offers a "keep me signed in" option that extends the browser session when the request is HTTPS (including trusted `X-Forwarded-Proto: https`) or localhost HTTP. The localhost exception uses the direct request `Host` and ignores forwarded host headers. Public HTTP deployments, including many temporary sandbox URLs, fall back to session cookies by default. DeerFlow never stores the password in browser storage; the UI may remember only the email address.

DeerFlow still uses `Forwarded` / `X-Forwarded-*` headers to recover the browser-facing scheme and origin behind a proxy. The bundled nginx sets `X-Forwarded-Proto`, but preserves an upstream HTTPS value and does not overwrite every forwarded header. Configure the outer trusted proxy to replace or strip client-supplied forwarding headers before traffic reaches DeerFlow.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Gateway still owns active run tasks in process, so production defaults to a single Gateway worker (`GATEWAY_WORKERS=1`). Multi-worker deployments require Postgres, the Redis stream bridge (`stream_bridge.type: redis`), `run_ownership.heartbeat_enabled: true`, and `run_events.backend: db`; process-local memory/JSONL event stores cannot enforce singleton delivery receipts across workers. The bridge shares SSE delivery and bounded `Last-Event-ID` replay across workers. When a valid reconnect cursor has been trimmed, or a subscriber that already established an empty-stream wait falls behind before its first delivery, Memory and Redis emit a machine-readable SSE `gap` event instead of silently returning a partial replay; the Web UI reloads durable thread/event state and resumes from the retained tail. Lease reconciliation marks runs from dead workers as errors, persists their delivery receipts, publishes the terminal stream marker, schedules retained-stream cleanup, and updates the affected thread status. SSE and `/wait` consumers also refresh durable status on heartbeats as a fallback if terminal publication fails. Malformed Redis reconnect IDs live-tail new events instead of replaying the retained buffer, and the rolling retained-buffer TTL (`stream_ttl_seconds`) remains a cleanup safety net rather than a run timeout. IM channel state and other process-local services still need their own multi-worker coordination.
>
> Run cancellation may land on any Gateway worker. A non-owning worker now persists the interrupt or rollback request for the live owner, which observes it during lease renewal and performs the normal cancellation flow; load-balancer routing alone no longer produces a 409. The first accepted action wins even if a retry lands on the owner, and accepted cancellation competes atomically with owner completion. Dead owners still follow lease takeover and orphan recovery. Cancellation latency is therefore bounded by the lease heartbeat interval.
>
> With lease heartbeat enabled, a transient RunStore renewal error is retried only until the last confirmed lease expires; the stale worker then cancels local execution and suppresses checkpoint, completion-hook, delivery-receipt, and thread-status finalization. A remote tool side effect already in flight may still be outside local cancellation.
>
> Reconciliation uses an atomic takeover claim that re-checks the lease after candidate selection, so a successful owner renewal wins over orphan recovery and only one reconciler can report a run as recovered. When multiple Gateway workers share the Docker/AIO or E2B sandbox backend, also configure `sandbox.ownership.type: redis`; E2B uses the leases during background startup and periodic reconciliation so duplicate/orphan cleanup cannot terminate a live peer's sandbox.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed Docker development guide.

#### Option 2: Local Development

If you prefer running services locally:

Prerequisite: complete the "Configuration" steps above first (`make setup`). `make dev` requires a valid `config.yaml` in the project root. Set `DEER_FLOW_PROJECT_ROOT` to define that root explicitly, or `DEER_FLOW_CONFIG_PATH` to point at a specific config file. Runtime state defaults to `.deer-flow` under the project root and can be moved with `DEER_FLOW_HOME`; skills default to `skills/` under the project root and can be moved with `DEER_FLOW_SKILLS_PATH`. Run `make doctor` to verify your setup before starting.
On Windows, run the local development flow from Git Bash. Native `cmd.exe` and PowerShell shells are not supported for the bash-based service scripts, and WSL is not guaranteed because some scripts rely on Git for Windows utilities such as `cygpath`.

1. **Check prerequisites**:
   ```bash
   make check  # Verifies Node.js 22+, pnpm, uv, nginx
   ```

   The local `make check`, `make install`, `make dev`, and `make start` entry points use a direct `pnpm`/`pnpm.cmd` executable when available and otherwise fall back to `corepack pnpm`. The shared runner and diagnostics resolve repository paths absolutely, so these checks work regardless of the caller's current directory. Corepack runs from `frontend/`, so it honors the `packageManager` version pinned in `frontend/package.json`; enabling a global pnpm shim is not required.

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   make install  # Install backend + frontend dependencies + pre-commit hooks
   ```

3. **(Optional) Pre-pull sandbox image**:
   ```bash
   # Recommended if using Docker/Container-based sandbox
   make setup-sandbox
   ```

4. **(Optional) Load sample memory data for local review**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/load_memory_sample.py
   ```
   This copies the sample fixture into the default local runtime memory file so reviewers can immediately test `Settings > Memory`.
   See [backend/docs/MEMORY_SETTINGS_REVIEW.md](backend/docs/MEMORY_SETTINGS_REVIEW.md) for the shortest review flow.

5. **Start services**:
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

6. **Access**: http://localhost:2026

Local services always use their internal ports (`8001`, `3000`, and `2026`).
The root `.env` variable `PORT` configures only the published Docker ingress;
it does not change the Next.js port used by `make dev`.

#### Startup Modes

DeerFlow runs the agent runtime inside the Gateway API. Development mode enables hot-reload; production mode uses a pre-built frontend.

| | **Local Foreground** | **Local Daemon** | **Docker Dev** | **Docker Prod** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Dev** | `./scripts/serve.sh --dev`<br/>`make dev` | `./scripts/serve.sh --dev --daemon`<br/>`make dev-daemon` | `./scripts/docker.sh start`<br/>`make docker-start` | — |
| **Prod** | `./scripts/serve.sh --prod`<br/>`make start` | `./scripts/serve.sh --prod --daemon`<br/>`make start-daemon` | — | `./scripts/deploy.sh`<br/>`make up` |

| Action | Local | Docker Dev | Docker Prod |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Stop** | `./scripts/serve.sh --stop`<br/>`make stop` | `./scripts/docker.sh stop`<br/>`make docker-stop` | `./scripts/deploy.sh down`<br/>`make down` |
| **Restart** | `./scripts/serve.sh --restart [flags]` | `./scripts/docker.sh restart` | — |

Gateway owns `/api/langgraph/*` and translates those public LangGraph-compatible paths to its native `/api/*` routers behind nginx.

#### LangGraph Studio (Optional)

The default `make dev` topology uses DeerFlow's Gateway-embedded runtime and
does not require LangGraph Studio. To inspect and test the registered lead-agent
graph with the standalone development server, run the command from `backend/`
so the CLI discovers `langgraph.json`:

```bash
cd backend
uv run langgraph dev --allow-blocking
```

The command prints the local API and Studio UI URLs. This in-memory server is
for development and testing only. The flag permits DeerFlow's synchronous
configuration and graph-factory setup during local Studio requests; it must not
be treated as a production-server setting. Local Studio authentication is
handled automatically, so the connection does not require custom headers. Use
DeerFlow's documented production startup modes or a supported LangSmith
deployment for production workloads. Assistant ownership and provenance in this
standalone mode are server-owned: Studio can discover registered graphs and the
assistants it creates, and normal assistant-version selection remains available.
Before the locked local runtime loads its persisted development store, DeerFlow
repairs legacy assistant rows and version history so historical client metadata
cannot restore server privileges or be discarded by the runtime's startup
cleanup. Keep the backend dependencies synchronized with `uv sync`; this
compatibility path requires the declared LangGraph runtime versions and logs a
warning if the persisted-store contract no longer matches its expectations.
The documented command uses LangGraph's file-based custom-app loader, which is
also covered directly by DeerFlow's regression tests.

For workflows that invoke `backend/langgraph.json` through LangGraph Studio or
a direct LangGraph Server, DeerFlow consumes the authenticated identity
published by that runtime and uses it for custom-agent configuration/SOUL, user
skills and skill policy, uploads, thread data, and memory reads/writes. This
keeps authenticated runs out of the shared `default` filesystem bucket, and the
server-owned identity takes precedence over ordinary client-supplied `user_id`
values. External identities such as email addresses are mapped to stable,
collision-resistant directory-safe user IDs before accessing DeerFlow storage.
The default DeerFlow service topology remains the Gateway-embedded runtime
described above.

Gateway runs automatically enforce native delivery for artifacts created or modified under `/mnt/user-data/outputs`: `present_files` must present at least one output produced by the current run, and the terminal `run.delivery` receipt must be durably recorded. Virtual artifact paths are resolved within the same authenticated user and thread scope that produced the output before the output-directory boundary is validated. Runs that do not produce output artifacts keep ordinary conversational behavior.

DeerFlow's built-in custom events are available through both LangGraph streaming interfaces: native clients can continue subscribing to `stream_mode="custom"`, while callback-based integrations can consume the same payloads as `on_custom_event` records from `astream_events(version="v2")`. The callback event name matches the payload's `type` field.

#### Docker Production Deployment

`deploy.sh` supports building and starting separately:

```bash
# One-step (build + start)
deploy.sh

# Two-step (build once, start later)
deploy.sh build              # build all images
deploy.sh start              # start pre-built images

# Stop
deploy.sh down
```

### Advanced
#### Sandbox Mode

DeerFlow supports multiple sandbox execution modes:
- **Local Execution** (runs sandbox code directly on the host machine)
- **Docker Execution** (runs sandbox code in isolated Docker containers)
- **Docker Execution with Kubernetes** (runs sandbox code in Kubernetes pods via provisioner service)

For Docker development, service startup follows `config.yaml` sandbox mode. In Local/Docker modes, `provisioner` is not started.

See the [Sandbox Configuration Guide](backend/docs/CONFIGURATION.md#sandbox) to configure your preferred mode.

#### MCP Server

DeerFlow supports configurable MCP servers and skills to extend its capabilities.
For HTTP/SSE MCP servers, OAuth token flows are supported (`client_credentials`, `refresh_token`).
For stdio MCP servers, per-tool call timeouts can be configured with `tool_call_timeout`; durable background-task calls honor the same setting for HTTP/SSE servers as well.
MCP tool names are prefixed with `<server_name>_` by default to prevent collisions across servers. If a server already namespaces its own tools, set `tool_name_prefix: false` on that server in `extensions_config.json` to keep the original names. Disable the prefix only when the resulting names remain unique across all enabled servers.
Settings > Tools updates one MCP server at a time: an invalid stdio command on one server no longer blocks toggling another, while enabling that invalid server remains protected by the command allowlist and surfaces the backend validation message in the UI.
Targeted updates accept both DeerFlow's `type` field and the MCP-spec `transport` field for SSE/HTTP servers.
Runtime MCP and skill updates replace `extensions_config.json` atomically, so an interrupted write cannot leave the shared configuration truncated or partially written.
MCP routing hints can also prefer a specific MCP tool for matching requests without forbidding other tools. When `tool_search` defers MCP schemas, matching routing metadata can auto-promote up to `tool_search.auto_promote_top_k` deferred schemas before the model call.

OpenViking users can register the official Streamable HTTP endpoint at `/mcp`
with an owner-bound USER API key. The native `forget` tool is exposed for
capability parity; deletion is irreversible, so it should be called only after
explicit user confirmation. DeerFlow does not enforce that confirmation. This
explicit, model-selected MCP tool path can run alongside the separate automatic
OpenViking memory backend; it does not replace automatic turn capture or recall. See the
[OpenViking MCP tools configuration](backend/docs/MCP_SERVER.md#openviking-mcp-tools).

The Gateway can adapt an MCP server's ordinary `submit` / `status` / `cancel` tools into durable background tasks. The Agent sees only the configured submit tool and a DeerFlow-local task ID; remote IDs are persisted before the submit call returns, while status and cancel stay internal to the runtime. Polling uses cross-worker leases, exponential retry backoff, scoped MCP sessions, bounded result storage, and restart recovery. A status-tool `isError` is retained as a bounded diagnostic and retried; servers report a permanent remote-task outcome through a normal structured result with `status: "failed"`. Remote poll hints are finite positive numbers capped at 24 hours, artifact-reference JSON is limited to 64 KiB, and task/server identifiers are validated against their durable SQL column limits before persistence. Input-required and terminal updates wake the current chat through idempotent Agent runs, while `list_background_tasks` and `cancel_background_task` let the Agent manage tasks without asking users for remote handles. Current-thread tasks are available through `GET /api/threads/{thread_id}/mcp-tasks`, its detail endpoint, and `POST /api/threads/{thread_id}/mcp-tasks/{task_id}/cancel`; when the task runtime actually starts, the Web UI exposes the same safe local view from the chat header with live status refresh, cancellation, and on-demand result, artifact, input-request, status-error, and cancellation-retry details. Default-disabled and memory-backend deployments hide that UI and do not poll the task endpoints. A failed remote cancellation remains queued with backoff, and its latest bounded error and attempt count stay visible in the expanded task card. Enable `mcp_tasks` in `config.yaml`, configure `task_toolsets` with exact raw tool names in `extensions_config.json`, and use a SQL database backend (`sqlite` or `postgres`). Task-enabled server connection, authentication, interceptor, timeout, or binding changes require a Gateway restart so Agent tool discovery and background calls cannot use different configuration versions. `input_required` is notification-only for now: DeerFlow can display the request but cannot yet submit the user's answer back to the remote task.

Notification launch and failed Agent-run deliveries use capped exponential backoff with a visible attempt count and stop after five failed attempts. A permanently rejected target such as a deleted chat is dead-lettered immediately instead of retried forever or recreated. Cancellation endpoints return after durably recording the request; the background service owns the potentially slow remote MCP call and its retry schedule.

Notification runs keep their trusted delivery instruction separate from the framed, untrusted remote event payload. The process-started task runtime—not a hot config read—controls whether the task-management tools are exposed, so changing `mcp_tasks` requires a Gateway restart. When a skill's `allowed-tools` policy is active, `list_background_tasks` and `cancel_background_task` must be declared explicitly like other business tools.
See the [MCP Server Guide](backend/docs/MCP_SERVER.md) for detailed instructions.

Security: pass per-request MCP credentials only through `config.context.secrets`;
credentials must never be placed in either run metadata surface
(`metadata.auth_token` or `config.metadata.auth_token`). See [MCP credential migration and cleanup](backend/docs/MCP_SERVER.md#migrating-legacy-mcp-credentials)
for the supported interceptor flow and the required rotation and retained-copy
cleanup when migrating from legacy metadata credentials.

#### IM Channels

DeerFlow supports receiving tasks from messaging apps. Channels auto-start when configured — no public IP required for any of them.

DeerFlow can also expose user-owned IM channel connections in the workspace UI. When `channel_connections` is enabled, logged-in users can bind Telegram, Slack, Discord, Feishu/Lark, DingTalk, WeChat, WeCom, or Buzz from the sidebar / Settings > Channels. It reuses the existing outbound `channels.*` transports, so no public IP or provider callback URL is required. Incoming IM messages then run under the connected DeerFlow user account. See [IM Channel Connections](backend/docs/IM_CHANNEL_CONNECTIONS.md) for setup and security notes.

| Channel | Transport | Difficulty |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Telegram | Bot API (long-polling) | Easy |
| Slack | Socket Mode | Moderate |
| Feishu / Lark | WebSocket | Moderate |
| WeChat | Tencent iLink (long-polling) | Moderate |
| WeCom | WebSocket | Moderate |
| DingTalk | Stream Push (WebSocket) | Moderate |
| Buzz | Nostr relay (WebSocket, NIP-42) | Moderate |

    card_template_id: ""                       # Optional: AI Card template ID for streaming typewriter effect
```

Notes:
- `assistant_id: lead_agent` calls the default LangGraph assistant directly.
- If `assistant_id` is set to a custom agent name, DeerFlow still routes through `lead_agent` and injects that value as `agent_name`, so the custom agent's SOUL/config takes effect for IM channels.
- IM channel workers call Gateway's LangGraph-compatible API internally and automatically attach process-local internal auth plus the CSRF cookie/header pair required for thread and run creation.
- Inbound work is bounded to `inbound_queue_maxsize` pending messages plus `max_concurrency` active workers. When capacity is exhausted, socket/polling providers drop new messages before sending DeerFlow's working acknowledgment and emit a rate-limited warning. Buzz leaves its replay cursor unchanged and reconnects for relay replay; GitHub webhooks return `503`, marking the delivery failed for manual/API redelivery. Shutdown closes admission immediately, keeps channel transports available while accepted messages drain for up to `shutdown_grace_period_seconds`, then cancels and awaits active handlers before closing provider resources; the Gateway's outer timeout can cancel an incomplete shutdown without detaching those resources.
- Feishu/Lark now queues rapid follow-up messages per mapped DeerFlow `thread_id` instead of immediately surfacing the generic busy reply, and topic replies keep a per-message card with a compact source-message preview across queued/running/final patches.

Set the corresponding API keys in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Telegram
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrSTUvwxYZ

# Slack
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-...

# Feishu / Lark
FEISHU_APP_ID=cli_xxxx
FEISHU_APP_SECRET=your_app_secret

# WeChat iLink
WECHAT_BOT_TOKEN=your_ilink_bot_token
WECHAT_ILINK_BOT_ID=your_ilink_bot_id

# WeCom
WECOM_BOT_ID=your_bot_id
WECOM_BOT_SECRET=your_bot_secret

# DingTalk
DINGTALK_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
DINGTALK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```

**Telegram Setup**

1. Chat with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), send `/newbot`, and copy the HTTP API token.
2. Set `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` in `.env` and enable the channel in `config.yaml`.
3. The bot accepts inbound text, photos, and documents (with or without captions). Hosted Bot API downloads are limited to 20 MB per attachment.

**Slack Setup**

1. Create a Slack App at [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) → Create New App → From scratch.
2. Under **OAuth & Permissions**, add Bot Token Scopes: `app_mentions:read`, `chat:write`, `im:history`, `im:read`, `im:write`, `files:write`.
3. Enable **Socket Mode** → generate an App-Level Token (`xapp-…`) with `connections:write` scope.
4. Under **Event Subscriptions**, subscribe to bot events: `app_mention`, `message.im`.
5. Set `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` in `.env` and enable the channel in `config.yaml`.

**Feishu / Lark Setup**

1. Create an app on [Feishu Open Platform](https://open.feishu.cn/) → enable **Bot** capability.
2. Add permissions: `im:message`, `im:message.p2p_msg:readonly`, `im:resource`.
3. Under **Events**, subscribe to `im.message.receive_v1` and select **Long Connection** mode.
4. Copy the App ID and App Secret. Set `FEISHU_APP_ID` and `FEISHU_APP_SECRET` in `.env` and enable the channel in `config.yaml`.

**WeChat Setup**

1. Enable the `wechat` channel in `config.yaml`.
2. Either set `WECHAT_BOT_TOKEN` in `.env`, or set `qrcode_login_enabled: true` for first-time QR bootstrap.
3. When `bot_token` is absent and QR bootstrap is enabled, watch backend logs for the QR content returned by iLink and complete the binding flow.
4. After the QR flow succeeds, DeerFlow persists the acquired token under `state_dir` for later restarts.
5. For Docker Compose deployments, keep `state_dir` on a persistent volume so the `get_updates_buf` cursor and saved auth state survive restarts.

**WeCom Setup**

1. Create a bot on the WeCom AI Bot platform and obtain the `bot_id` and `bot_secret`.
2. Enable `channels.wecom` in `config.yaml` and fill in `bot_id` / `bot_secret`.
3. Set `WECOM_BOT_ID` and `WECOM_BOT_SECRET` in `.env`.
4. Make sure backend dependencies include `wecom-aibot-python-sdk`. The channel uses a WebSocket long connection and does not require a public callback URL.
5. The current integration supports inbound text, image, and file messages. Final images/files generated by the agent are also sent back to the WeCom conversation.

**DingTalk Setup**

1. Create a DingTalk application in the [DingTalk Developer Console](https://open.dingtalk.com/) and enable **Robot** capability.
2. Set the message receiving mode to **Stream Mode** in the robot configuration page.
3. Copy the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`, set `DINGTALK_CLIENT_ID` and `DINGTALK_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env`, and enable the channel in `config.yaml`.
4. *(Optional)* To enable streaming AI Card replies (typewriter effect), create an **AI Card** template on the [DingTalk Card Platform](https://open.dingtalk.com/document/dingstart/typewriter-effect-streaming-ai-card), then set `card_template_id` in `config.yaml` to the template ID. You also need to apply for the `Card.Streaming.Write` and `Card.Instance.Write` permissions.


When DeerFlow runs in Docker Compose, IM channels execute inside the `gateway` container. In that case, do not point `channels.langgraph_url` or `channels.gateway_url` at `localhost`; use container service names such as `http://gateway:8001/api` and `http://gateway:8001`, or set `DEER_FLOW_CHANNELS_LANGGRAPH_URL` and `DEER_FLOW_CHANNELS_GATEWAY_URL`.

**Commands**

Once a channel is connected, you can interact with DeerFlow directly from the chat:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/new` | Start a new conversation |
| `/status` | Show current thread info |
| `/models` | List available models |
| `/memory` | View memory |
| `/help` | Show help |

> Messages without a command prefix are treated as regular chat — DeerFlow creates a thread and responds conversationally.

#### Request Trace Correlation

Gateway request trace correlation is disabled by default so existing HTTP responses and log formats stay unchanged. To enable it, set:

```yaml
logging:
  enhance:
    enabled: true
    format: text
```

When enabled, every Gateway HTTP response includes `X-Trace-Id`, logs include `trace_id`, and Langfuse traces created by that request include `metadata.deerflow_trace_id` with the same value.

Gateway run history also records one terminal `run.delivery` receipt per run,
including zero-output and crash-recovered runs. The receipt is persisted before
the durable terminal run status during normal execution. Orphan recovery first
atomically claims an expired lease and then idempotently backfills the receipt,
so a stale recovery scan cannot overwrite a live run's detailed delivery facts.
Receipt persistence remains best-effort during an event-store outage. Runs that
fail checkpoint preflight (or are cancelled while waiting for prior
finalization) keep the existing completion-data behavior: they receive the
zero-delivery receipt but do not overwrite RunStore completion fields with an
empty snapshot.

#### LangSmith Tracing

DeerFlow has built-in [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com) integration for observability. When enabled, all LLM calls, agent runs, and tool executions are traced and visible in the LangSmith dashboard.

Add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT=https://api.smith.langchain.com
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=lsv2_pt_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
LANGSMITH_PROJECT=xxx
```

#### Langfuse Tracing

DeerFlow also supports [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) observability for LangChain-compatible runs.

Add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
LANGFUSE_TRACING=true
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk-lf-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
LANGFUSE_BASE_URL=https://cloud.langfuse.com
```

If you are using a self-hosted Langfuse instance, set `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL` to your deployment URL.

**Trace correlation fields.** Every agent run is annotated with Langfuse's reserved trace attributes so the Sessions and Users pages light up automatically:

- `session_id` = LangGraph `thread_id` — groups every trace of the same conversation
- `user_id` = effective user from `get_effective_user_id()` (falls back to `default` in no-auth mode)
- `trace_name` = assistant id (defaults to `lead-agent`)
- `tags` = `[env:<DEER_FLOW_ENV>, model:<model_name>]` (omitted when not set)
- `metadata.deerflow_trace_id` = DeerFlow request correlation id, matching `X-Trace-Id` when request trace correlation is enabled

These are injected into `RunnableConfig.metadata` at the graph invocation root for both the gateway path (`runtime/runs/worker.py::run_agent`) and the embedded path (`client.py::DeerFlowClient.stream`), so any LangChain-compatible callback can read them. Set `DEER_FLOW_ENV` (or `ENVIRONMENT`) to tag traces by deployment environment.

#### Monocle Tracing

DeerFlow also supports [Monocle](https://github.com/monocle2ai/monocle), an OpenTelemetry-based tracer for agentic applications. It records each run end-to-end: LLM calls, agent steps, and tool and MCP invocations, with their inputs, outputs, timings, and token counts.

Add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
MONOCLE_TRACING=true
MONOCLE_EXPORTERS=file          # file, console, okahu, s3, blob, gcs (default: file)
OKAHU_API_KEY=okh_xxxxxxxx      # required only for the `okahu` exporter
```

Each run writes one trace file to `.monocle/`; open it in the [Monocle VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=OkahuAI.monocle-apptrace) to inspect the span timeline and token counts. Connect to [Okahu](https://www.okahu.ai), an agent-observability platform, to analyze traces across runs and run trace-based and agentic evaluations (via the `okahu` exporter).

Traces capture span inputs and outputs verbatim — prompts, tool arguments, and model responses — plus token usage and timings. The `file` exporter keeps them on local disk and never rotates or cleans them up, so prune `.monocle/` periodically; the remote exporters (`okahu`, `s3`, `blob`, `gcs`) send that same data off-box, so enable only destinations you trust. Monocle is initialized once at Gateway startup: a configuration error (unknown exporter, missing `OKAHU_API_KEY`) is logged there and tracing stays off until the Gateway restarts.

#### Using Multiple Providers

LangSmith and Langfuse attach as LangChain callbacks, so you can enable both and DeerFlow reports each run to both. If an enabled provider is missing required credentials or fails to initialize, DeerFlow fails fast and names it. Monocle uses a global OpenTelemetry provider rather than a callback; Langfuse shares that provider, so all three can run together. Because both span processors sit on the same shared provider, Monocle's exporters also see Langfuse's spans when both are enabled.

For Docker deployments, tracing is disabled by default. Set `LANGSMITH_TRACING=true` and `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` in your `.env` to enable it.

## From Deep Research to Super Agent Harness

DeerFlow started as a Deep Research framework — and the community ran with it. Since launch, developers have pushed it far beyond research: building data pipelines, generating slide decks, spinning up dashboards, automating content workflows. Things we never anticipated.

That told us something important: DeerFlow wasn't just a research tool. It was a **harness** — a runtime that gives agents the infrastructure to actually get work done.

So we rebuilt it from scratch.

DeerFlow 2.0 is no longer a framework you wire together. It's a super agent harness — batteries included, fully extensible. Built on LangGraph and LangChain, it ships with everything an agent needs out of the box: a filesystem, memory, skills, sandbox-aware execution, and the ability to plan and spawn sub-agents for complex, multi-step tasks.

Use it as-is. Or tear it apart and make it yours.

## Core Features

### Skills & Tools

Skills are what make DeerFlow do *almost anything*.

A standard Agent Skill is a structured capability module — a Markdown file that defines a workflow, best practices, and references to supporting resources. DeerFlow ships with built-in skills for research, report generation, slide creation, web pages, image and video generation, and more. But the real power is extensibility: add your own skills, replace the built-in ones, or combine them into compound workflows.

Skills are loaded progressively — only when the task needs them, not all at once. This keeps the context window lean and makes DeerFlow work well even with token-sensitive models.

A skill directory is a package boundary: once DeerFlow finds its `SKILL.md`, nested `SKILL.md` files under that package (for example evaluation fixtures) remain supporting data and are not registered as runtime skills. Namespace directories without their own `SKILL.md` can still group nested skills.

Users can explicitly activate an enabled skill for a single turn by starting the request with `/skill-name`, for example `/data-analysis analyze uploads/foo.csv`. DeerFlow loads that skill's `SKILL.md` as hidden current-turn context while leaving the base prompt limited to skill metadata. Slash activation respects disabled skills, custom-agent skill whitelists, and existing channel commands such as `/new` and `/help`.

An enabled skill's `allowed-tools` policy applies only after that skill is explicitly slash-activated or captured in the agent's active skill context after a `read_file` load. Merely enabling, advertising, or listing a skill in a custom agent or subagent `skills` allowlist does not reduce that agent's normal toolset; subagents use the same progressive discovery and activation policy as the lead agent. During a slash-activated run, that explicit skill's policy is authoritative: reading another `SKILL.md` may provide instructions but cannot widen the slash skill's tools. Without slash activation, policies from skills actually loaded into active context retain their union semantics. Once active, the policy filters both model-visible tool schemas and tool execution. Framework discovery tools (`tool_search` and `describe_skill`) remain available so an allowed deferred tool or installed skill can still be discovered, but discovery and promotion never grant permission to execute a business tool omitted from `allowed-tools`. `task` is not framework-exempt; a restrictive skill must list it explicitly to delegate to a subagent. Per-step policy decisions are internal runtime context and are removed from observable or persisted context copies. Registry failures and an active set with no remaining valid skill fail closed to framework-safe tools; individual stale paths are ignored only when another valid active skill remains. This is best-effort behavioral scoping, not a hard security boundary: loading skill instructions through another tool is not captured, and active-skill entries can be evicted from bounded context.

When you install `.skill` archives through the Gateway, DeerFlow accepts standard optional frontmatter metadata such as `version`, `author`, and `compatibility` instead of rejecting otherwise valid external skills.

Disabling a skill also removes it from the sandbox filesystem view, so shell commands and structured file tools follow the same enabled state. Local, Docker/AIO, hostPath provisioner, and newly created E2B sandboxes source `/mnt/skills` from enabled-only projections that update when public, custom, legacy, or managed integration skills are toggled, edited, created, deleted, or installed. Structured `read_file` calls (including line ranges and read-before-write checks) use the sandbox provider's mount mapping, so the user identity captured when the sandbox was acquired remains authoritative. Managed integration packages remain shared, while their projected filesystem visibility follows each user's enabled state. Multi-worker Gateways re-read on-disk enable state while rebuilding user projections, so a toggle handled by one worker is honored by another worker's next sandbox acquire. Existing E2B sandboxes retain their creation-time snapshot until they are recreated. PVC-backed provisioner skills keep their configured PVC snapshot/layout for now; dynamic PVC materialization is tracked separately.

Managed integrations install shared read-only skill packs without mixing them
into custom skills. The Lark/Feishu CLI integration is available under
`Settings → Integrations → Lark / Feishu CLI`; an administrator installs or
upgrades the official `lark-*` pack once under
`{DEER_FLOW_HOME}/integrations/skills/lark-cli`, and every user discovers that
same pack with an independent enabled state. Each user's app configuration and
OAuth data remain isolated under
`{DEER_FLOW_HOME}/users/{user_id}/integrations/lark-cli/{config,data}`. These
secret directories are restricted to `0700`, regular credential files to
`0600`, and symlinks are rejected.

After installation, users can click **Connect Lark** to open a browser
authorization link; no terminal authorization is required. The same UI can
request additional permission domains such as Calendar, Docs, or Drive, or a
specific OAuth scope reported by `lark-cli`. A cheap status refresh only
inspects the local credential tree, so the UI reports **Credentials configured
(not live-verified)** until an explicit browser completion performs live token
verification. The action then remains **Reconnect Lark** so users can replace
or extend authorization. If an agent hits missing Lark authorization during a
conversation, the managed `lark-shared` guidance points the user back to the
same settings entry with `?settings=integrations`.

Once configured, **Change Lark app** lets a user point their DeerFlow account at
a different Lark/Feishu app without a reinstall — either by pasting an existing
app's App ID / App Secret or by re-registering an app in the browser. Switching
is per-user (it never touches another user's credentials), validates the new
credentials through the official CLI's live tenant-token probe before replacing
the active app, and revokes/removes the previous app's OAuth tokens. A rejected
credential change does not supersede an in-progress setup or authorization flow.
DeerFlow then immediately opens browser authorization for the newly bound app so
the switch ends in a usable connection.

Installing the Lark skill pack resolves the latest official `larksuite/cli`
release from GitHub and downloads that version's skills at install time, so the
Gateway needs outbound internet access for that step (it falls back to a
bottom-line pinned version if the release lookup fails). The settings page shows
the installed version and, when available, the newest published version so an
admin can reinstall to upgrade. Air-gapped deployments can pre-stage the archive
and point `DEER_FLOW_LARK_CLI_SKILLS_ARCHIVE` at the local file. Integrity does
not depend on a pinned archive byte hash (GitHub does not guarantee stable
source-archive bytes); instead the download is restricted to the official GitHub
host, every archive member passes structural safety guards, and a content hash
of the effective installed skill tree (including DeerFlow's injected shared
guidance) is recorded so content changes are auditable across reinstalls.

When `sandbox.use` selects the AIO provider, the same install also downloads the
official Linux amd64 and arm64 CLI release archives, verifies their published
SHA-256 checksums, safely extracts one executable per architecture, and mounts
the resulting runtime read-only at `/mnt/integrations/lark-cli/runtime`. An
architecture-selecting launcher in that mount makes `lark-cli` available in the
sandbox `PATH`. Air-gapped AIO deployments can pre-stage a symlink-free runtime
tree containing `bin/lark-cli` plus both `linux-{amd64,arm64}/lark-cli` files and
set `DEER_FLOW_LARK_CLI_SANDBOX_RUNTIME_DIR` to that directory.

> **Sandbox trust boundary:** the browser never receives the Lark app secret, but
> agent conversations run `lark-cli` inside the sandbox, so the per-user
> credential directories are mounted into it: `config` (holding the long-lived
> `appSecret`) is mounted **read-only**, its otherwise empty `config/locks`
> subdirectory is over-mounted writable for `lark-cli` coordination files, and
> `data` (refreshable OAuth tokens) is writable. The credential-bearing config
> and data mounts remain *readable* by any process the agent runs there, so code
> reached via prompt injection in a tool result could read them. Treat the
> sandbox as inside the Lark credential trust boundary until the sidecar
> credential-broker follow-up removes these mounts from sandbox execution.

For remote/Kubernetes deployments (the provisioner backend), the sandbox
`lark-cli` runtime can instead be supplied by an optional init container that
copies the binaries into a shared `emptyDir` — no install-time GitHub download and
no hostPath/PVC runtime mount. Publish the image under
[`docker/lark-cli-init`](docker/lark-cli-init/README.md) and set
`LARK_CLI_INIT_IMAGE` on the provisioner; it stays off (legacy behavior) when
unset. The Lark integration status (`GET /api/integrations/lark/status`) reports
`sandbox_runtime_mode` and `sandbox_runtime_ready` so the Settings UI shows
whether `lark-cli` will actually be present in the sandbox at chat time, rather
than a green status hiding a later `command not found`.

If a trusted operator manages the configured skills directory through an external mount such as MinIO, NFS, or CSI, an administrator can call `POST /api/skills/reload` after changing files. This invalidates skill prompt caches for the current Gateway process and waits up to the bounded refresh timeout so subsequent runs rescan the latest files; running tasks are unchanged. A loader-level filesystem failure returns a generic server error and preserves the last successfully loaded process cache rather than publishing an empty catalog. Uvicorn workers and Kubernetes Pods must each be targeted separately. Direct mount writes bypass the validation, SkillScan, and history applied by DeerFlow's install/edit APIs, so only operator-controlled systems should have write access.

Skill installs and agent-managed skill edits run through **SkillScan**, a native deterministic safety scanner before the LLM-based skill scanner. Phase 1 runs offline with no Semgrep/OpenGrep dependency, blocks high-confidence `CRITICAL` findings such as private keys or shell execution, and passes warning findings to the LLM scanner for contextual review. Python instance-client exfiltration checks follow a minimal same-scope evidence chain: a simple name bound to a known client constructor, optional name-to-name aliases, and an actual outbound method or context-manager use supported by that constructor. Constructor roots must be proven imports; bare canonical-looking names are not inferred as modules. Nested scopes do not inherit client handles and inherit only constructor import aliases that are never rebound in the enclosing scope. Comprehensions, walrus-bearing statements, annotations, complex binding targets, unsupported operations, and ambiguous branch flows produce no finding from this signal; skipped constructs conservatively invalidate every name they may bind so stale client state cannot create a finding. A deterministic work budget or recursion limit reached by this best-effort analysis does not discard findings already collected for the file. Set `skill_scan.enabled: false` in `config.yaml` to disable only the deterministic analyzers; safe archive extraction and the LLM scanner still run.

DeerFlow also ships with **skill-reviewer**, a public skill for read-only skill quality review. It uses the built-in `review_skill_package` tool to inspect installed skills, local packages, archives, or pasted `SKILL.md` content without activating the target skill, binding its secrets, executing its scripts, or installing it. The tool returns a compact, tag-neutralized JSON payload to the model context and keeps the full raw review payload in the tool artifact for programmatic consumers. The deterministic review core reuses DeerFlow parsing and SkillScan facts, emits versioned JSON contracts under `contracts/skill_review/`, and can be run from the backend CLI:

```bash
cd backend
uv run python -m deerflow.skills.review.cli ../skills/public/data-analysis --format text --fail-on error --fail-on-incomplete
```

Tools follow the same philosophy. DeerFlow comes with a core toolset — web search, web fetch, rendered web capture, file operations, bash execution — and supports custom tools via MCP servers and Python functions. Swap anything. Add anything.

Advanced deployments can enable pluggable authorization with `authorization.enabled` in `config.yaml`. A configured `AuthorizationProvider` filters denied tools before they reach the model or deferred-tool catalog, then the same provider is checked again before every business-tool execution through the existing guardrail middleware. Gateway `threads:*` and `runs:*` route permissions are derived from the same provider, while existing owner checks and admin-only management gates remain in force. A generated `tool_search` may bypass the second tool check only when it fronts the current build's already-filtered deferred catalog. The built-in RBAC provider supports per-role `tools` and `routes` allow/deny policies and validates that `default_role` names a configured role; authorization is disabled by default. See `config.example.yaml` and the [authorization RFC](docs/plans/2026-07-10-pluggable-authorization-rfc.md).

Advanced deployments can also extend the agent runtime itself by declaring zero-argument `AgentMiddleware` classes under `extensions.middlewares` in `config.yaml` or `extensions_config.json`. DeerFlow loads the same configured class list into the lead-agent and subagent pipelines after their built-in runtime middlewares and loop/token guards, but before the terminal-response/safety/clarification tail, so enterprise forks can add domain guardrails, tool-call governance, or observability hooks without patching the built-in middleware builders. Missing packages, invalid classes, and broken modules fail loudly at agent creation. Treat `config.yaml` and `extensions_config.json` as trusted operator-controlled files: middleware paths are code execution, just like custom tool, model, sandbox, guardrail, MCP server, and MCP interceptor declarations. Gateway skill/MCP toggle endpoints preserve this field but do not expose an API write path for `extensions.middlewares`. Per-context parameterization and separate lead-only/subagent-only middleware lists are not supported yet.

For packaged and configurable runtime integrations, use DeerFlow's extension manager.
It accepts a Python package requirement, a public HTTPS Git URL, or a local directory, installs the
package into the backend's dedicated `extensions` dependency group, updates
`backend/uv.lock`, and adds an enabled entry to the startup-only top-level `plugins:` list
in `config.yaml`:

```bash
# PyPI — pin a version for a reproducible deployment
make extension-install SOURCE="deerflow-extension-acme==1.2.3"

# Public HTTPS Git — pin an immutable commit
make extension-install \
```
