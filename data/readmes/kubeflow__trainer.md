## Overview

Kubeflow Trainer is a Kubernetes-native distributed AI platform for scalable large language model
(LLM) fine-tuning and training of AI models across a wide range of frameworks, including
PyTorch, MLX, HuggingFace, DeepSpeed, JAX, XGBoost, and more.

Kubeflow Trainer brings MPI to Kubernetes, orchestrating multi-node, multi-GPU distributed
jobs efficiently across high-performance computing (HPC) clusters. This enables high-throughput
communication between processes, making it ideal for large-scale AI training that requires
ultra-fast synchronization between GPUs nodes.

Kubeflow Trainer seamlessly integrates with the Cloud Native AI ecosystem, including
[Kueue](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tasks/run/trainjobs/) for topology-aware scheduling and
multi-cluster job dispatching, as well as [JobSet](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/jobset) and
[LeaderWorkerSet](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/lws) for AI workload orchestration.

Kubeflow Trainer provides a distributed data cache designed to stream large-scale data with zero-copy
transfer directly to GPU nodes. This ensures memory-efficient training jobs while maximizing
GPU utilization.

With [the Kubeflow Python SDK](https://github.com/kubeflow/sdk), AI practitioners can effortlessly
develop and fine-tune LLMs while leveraging the Kubeflow Trainer APIs: TrainJob and Runtimes.

## Acknowledgement

This project was originally started as a distributed training operator for TensorFlow and later we
merged efforts from other Kubeflow Training Operators to provide a unified and simplified experience
for both users and developers. We are very grateful to all who filed issues or helped resolve them,
asked and answered questions, and were part of inspiring discussions.
We'd also like to thank everyone who's contributed to and maintained the original operators.
