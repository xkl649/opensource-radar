## What is Agent Squad?

Agent Squad routes each user query to the most suitable of your specialized agents and maintains conversation context across them. You get pre-built agents, classifiers, and storage for quick deployment, plus small, well-defined seams to plug in your own.

- 🧠 **Intelligent intent classification** — route queries by context and content.
- 🌊 **Streaming and non-streaming** agent responses.
- 📚 **Context management** — coherent conversations across agents and sessions.
- 🔧 **Extensible by design** — custom agents, classifiers, storage, and retrievers.
- 📦 **Pre-built agents** — Bedrock, Anthropic, OpenAI, Lex, Lambda, and more.

## Three runtimes, one framework

| Runtime | Requirements |
|---|---|
| [**Python**](#python) | Python 3.11+ |
| [**TypeScript**](#typescript) | Node.js |
| [**Swift**](#swift) — **new** | iOS 16+ / macOS 14+ |

Python and TypeScript maintain feature parity and run anywhere — AWS Lambda, containers, your laptop. The new **Swift runtime** brings the same orchestration model to Apple platforms and runs **entirely on device**: classifier routing, tools (native and [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)), realtime voice, tracing, and local-first chat storage.

## How it works

![High-level architecture flow diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/2fastlabs/agent-squad/main/img/flow.jpg)

1. User input is analyzed by a **Classifier**.
2. The Classifier uses the agents' descriptions and the conversation history to select the best agent for the turn.
3. The selected **Agent** processes the input (calling tools as needed).
4. The **Orchestrator** saves the exchange and returns the response.

## Quick start

### TypeScript

```bash
npm install agent-squad
```

```typescript
import { AgentSquad, BedrockLLMAgent } from "agent-squad";

const orchestrator = new AgentSquad();

orchestrator.addAgent(
  new BedrockLLMAgent({
    name: "Tech Agent",
    description: "Specializes in technology: software, hardware, AI, cybersecurity, cloud.",
    streaming: true
  })
);

const response = await orchestrator.routeRequest("What is AWS Lambda?", "user123", "session456");

console.log(`> Agent: ${response.metadata.agentName}\n`);
if (response.streaming) {
  for await (const chunk of response.output) {
    if (typeof chunk === "string") process.stdout.write(chunk);
  }
} else {
  console.log(response.output);
}
```

### Python

```bash
pip install "agent-squad[aws]"   # or [anthropic], [openai], [all] — see the docs
```

```python
import asyncio
from agent_squad.orchestrator import AgentSquad
from agent_squad.agents import BedrockLLMAgent, BedrockLLMAgentOptions, AgentStreamResponse

orchestrator = AgentSquad()
orchestrator.add_agent(BedrockLLMAgent(BedrockLLMAgentOptions(
    name="Tech Agent",
    description="Specializes in technology: software, hardware, AI, cybersecurity, cloud.",
    streaming=True,
)))

async def main():
    response = await orchestrator.route_request("What is AWS Lambda?", "user123", "session456", {}, True)

    print(f"> Agent: {response.metadata.agent_name}\n")
    if response.streaming:
        async for chunk in response.output:
            if isinstance(chunk, AgentStreamResponse):
                print(chunk.text, end="", flush=True)
    else:
        print(response.output.content)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Swift

Add the package to your `Package.swift` (or via Xcode → Add Package Dependencies):

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/2FastLabs/agent-squad", branch: "main")
]
```

```swift
import AgentSquad

let agent = Agent(name: "Shop", description: "Shopping assistant",
                  model: ChatCompletionsClient(model: "gpt-4o-mini", apiKey: apiKey))
let orchestrator = Orchestrator(agents: [agent], store: try DeviceChatStorage(userId: "u1"))

for try await event in orchestrator.route(.text("wireless headphones under €100?"),
                                          userId: "u1", sessionId: "s1") {
    if case .textDelta(let token) = event { print(token, terminator: "") }
}
```

## SupervisorAgent — team coordination

A lead agent coordinates a team of specialized agents in parallel using an *agent-as-tools* architecture, maintaining shared context and delivering one coherent response.

![SupervisorAgent flow diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/2fastlabs/agent-squad/main/img/flow-supervisor.jpg)

- **Team coordination** with **parallel** sub-agent queries and smart shared context.
- **Dynamic delegation** of subtasks to the right team member.
- Works with **all agent types** — and can itself be registered in the classifier to build hierarchical teams of teams.

## GroundedAgent — answers that can't drift from your data

Available in **all three runtimes**, `GroundedAgent` is the framework's anti-hallucination pattern: two LLMs instead of one.

![GroundedAgent flow diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/2fastlabs/agent-squad/main/docs/public/grounded-agent.png)

- A **gatherer** calls your tools and sees the raw results — but never speaks to the user.
- An isolated **presenter** writes the reply from the curated tool output alone: no tools, no tool transcript, no chat history. It cannot invent a price, a rating, or a stock status that wasn't actually fetched.
- A no-tool turn skips the presenter and answers in one pass.

Use it wherever answers must match the data exactly — prices, odds, balances, availability.

## New: the Swift runtime — on-device orchestration

The orchestration model above, rebuilt for Apple platforms as a protocol-driven Swift 6 package — designed to run the whole loop **on device**:

- 🧠 **Swappable agents** — `Agent`, `GroundedAgent`, or your own `AgentProtocol` conformance, routed by an optional `LLMClassifier`.
- 🧰 **Tools from any source** — native Swift functions, declarative HTTP tools, or any **MCP server**, composed behind one seam.
- 🎙️ **Realtime voice** — natural spoken conversations with interrupt-to-speak, sharing the same grounded gatherer → presenter core.
- 📈 **First-class tracing** — OSLog during development, OTLP export (Langfuse, LangSmith, Datadog, …) in production.
- 💾 **Local-first chat history** — JSON-file or SwiftData persistence on device, swappable like everything else.

Start with the [Swift README](swift/README.md) and the [Swift docs](https://2fastlabs.github.io/agent-squad/swift/quick-start/).

## Building with an AI assistant

Each runtime ships a **skill** — a single, assistant-agnostic guide that gives an AI assistant the mental model, real API signatures, task recipes, and gotchas it needs to write correct code with the framework:

| Runtime | Skill file |
|---|---|
| Python | [`python/SKILL.md`](python/SKILL.md) |
| TypeScript | [`typescript/SKILL.md`](typescript/SKILL.md) |
| Swift | [`swift/SKILL.md`](swift/SKILL.md) |

These files are not auto-installed — point your assistant at the relevant one. For example:

> *Read `python/SKILL.md` before writing any agent-squad Python code.*

Works with any assistant (Claude, Cursor, Copilot, …).
