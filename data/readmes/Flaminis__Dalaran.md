# Dalaran

**Dalaran is an Apache-2.0, robotics-first observability and visualization stack
for multimodal time-series data — ROS 2 topics, LiDAR sweeps, camera streams,
IMU, and TF transforms, recorded and replayed on one timeline.**

You log data from your robot, your simulator, or an offline pipeline; Dalaran
stores it in an Arrow-backed columnar chunk store, renders it in a 3D/2D viewer
that stays in sync across every sensor, and hands the same data back to you as
dataframes when you want to compute on it instead of look at it.

---

## 60-second quickstart

### Python

```sh
pip install dalaran-sdk
```

```python
import dalaran as dl
import numpy as np

dl.init("dalaran_example_app", spawn=True)  # spawn a viewer process and stream to it

positions = np.random.default_rng(0).normal(size=(1000, 3)).astype(np.float32)
colors = np.random.default_rng(1).integers(0, 255, size=(1000, 3), dtype=np.uint8)

for frame in range(100):
    dl.set_time("frame", sequence=frame)
    dl.log("world/points", dl.Points3D(positions + frame * 0.01, colors=colors))
```

Write to a file instead of a live viewer with `dl.save("session.dlr")`, then
open it later with `dalaran session.dlr`.

### Rust

```sh
cargo add dalaran
```

```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let rec = dalaran::RecordingStreamBuilder::new("dalaran_example_app").spawn()?;

    let positions: Vec<_> = (0..1000)
        .map(|i| ((i % 10) as f32, ((i / 10) % 10) as f32, (i / 100) as f32))
        .collect();

    rec.set_time_sequence("frame", 0);
    rec.log("world/points", &dalaran::Points3D::new(positions))?;

    Ok(())
}
```

### C++

Fetch the SDK in your `CMakeLists.txt` and link against `dalaran_sdk`:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(dalaran_sdk URL
  https://github.com/Flaminis/Dalaran/releases/latest/download/dalaran_cpp_sdk.zip)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(dalaran_sdk)
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE dalaran_sdk)
```

```cpp
#include <dalaran.hpp>

int main() {
    const auto rec = dalaran::RecordingStream("dalaran_example_app");
    rec.spawn().exit_on_failure();

    rec.set_time_sequence("frame", 0);
    rec.log("world/points", dalaran::Points3D({{0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f}, {1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f}}));
}
```

### The viewer and CLI

The `dalaran` binary is both the viewer and the CLI. It ships with the Python
wheel, or you can install it on its own:

```sh
cargo install dalaran-cli --locked
dalaran --help
dalaran session.dlr        # open a recording
dalaran --serve            # serve a web viewer
```

Recordings are `.dlr` files and saved blueprints are `.dbl` files. Live streams
and remote catalogs are addressed with `dalaran://` URIs.

## Why Dalaran

Everything below is what Dalaran adds for robotics teams specifically, and
everything below works today — it is code in this repository with tests, not a
roadmap. What is *not* built yet lives in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

- **`dalaran.robot`, a high-level robotics logging API** — one handle that knows
  about a robot: joint states, base pose, sensor frames, and URDF-driven link
  transforms, so you log `robot.log_joint_states(...)` instead of hand-rolling a
  dozen entity paths and quaternion conversions. Point it at a URDF and joint
  limits, joint axes and `<mimic>` joints are honoured for you.
- **ROS 2 bridge and rosbag2 replay** — subscribe to live ROS 2
  topics or replay a rosbag2 into Dalaran, backed by an **extensible message
  registry** so you can teach it your own `.msg` types without patching the
  core. Today the repository already ingests MCAP and a set of common ROS
  message schemas.
- **ROS axis-convention helpers** — REP-103/REP-105 conventions (`x`-forward
  `z`-up, ENU vs. NED for positions *and* orientations, `map`/`odom`/`base_link`
  frame semantics that make the direction hard to get backwards) as first-class
  helpers, because silently mismatched axis conventions are the single most
  common way a robotics visualization ends up wrong.
- **Occupancy grids and costmaps** — `nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid`, `nav2_msgs/Costmap`
  and nav2's `/global_costmap` and `/local_costmap` topics land on the `GridMap`
  archetype with proper origin/resolution handling, instead of being flattened
  into an untyped image. nav2's cost semantics are modelled properly, so
  `INSCRIBED_INFLATED_OBSTACLE` and `LETHAL_OBSTACLE` are drawn as the categories
  they are rather than as points on the cost gradient, a costmap's layers stack
  as separate entities with their own draw order and opacity, and the rolling
  local window keeps one entity while its origin moves.
- **`dalaran doctor`** — a diagnostic subcommand that inspects your environment
  (build info, wgpu adapters and drivers, `DALARAN_*` variables, headless and
  ROS 2 setup, recording integrity) and tells you what is wrong in plain
  language. It lives in the viewer binary, so it still runs when your Python
  installation is the thing that is broken; `dalaran-doctor` covers the
  interpreter and SDK/viewer version skew from the Python side.
- **`.dlrpack` portable dataset bundles** — a single file that
  carries recordings, the blueprint, referenced assets, and metadata, so
  "here is the run that failed" is one artifact you can hand to a colleague.
- **Apache-2.0 throughout, self-hostable** — no dual-licence ambiguity, no
  hosted-service dependency. Everything in this repository runs on your own
  machines, and the catalog server is part of the open-source tree.

## Reading existing `.rrd` recordings

Dalaran did not change the storage container. The on-disk format still uses the
`RRF2` fourcc, so `dalaran recording.rrd` opens an upstream recording directly —
no renaming and no conversion step — and `dalaran convert` will turn one into a
`.dlr` if you want it normalized.

How far that goes, stated precisely, because "compatible" is easy to overclaim:

- **Container and framing: compatible.** The stream header, framing and footer
  are unchanged, and legacy `.rrd`/`.rbl` extensions are accepted everywhere
  `.dlr`/`.dbl` are.
- **Chunk data: compatible.** Upstream writes its Arrow metadata under `rerun:*`
  and Dalaran writes `dalaran:*`; readers accept both, so chunks, entity paths,
  timelines and segment ids resolve out of an upstream file.
- **Blueprints from upstream: partial.** Some component descriptors in upstream
  blueprint stores do not yet resolve here, so a recording's saved layout may be
  ignored while its data loads. Being worked on.
- **Very old recordings:** bounded by the same migration rules that apply
  upstream. Recordings from long-past versions may need a migration pass.

Language bindings live in [`dalaran_py/`](dalaran_py) (Python, package
`dalaran`, distribution `dalaran-sdk`), [`dalaran_cpp/`](dalaran_cpp) (C++,
namespace `dalaran::` with the alias `dl`), and [`dalaran_js/`](dalaran_js)

[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) has the long version.

## Status

Dalaran is under active development and the API is still evolving. Expect
breaking changes between releases, and read [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md)
before upgrading. We would rather ship a small honest surface than a large
speculative one, so features listed as *in progress* above are exactly that.

## Contributing

Bug reports, robotics-integration reports, and pull requests are welcome. Start
with [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the dev setup, commit
conventions, and sign-off requirement, and please read
[`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Security issues should not go through the public issue tracker — see
[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

## Branding

The Dalaran mark and wordmark live in [`docs/assets/`](docs/assets) and are
original artwork. [`docs/assets/BRANDING.md`](docs/assets/BRANDING.md) describes
the palette and how you may use them.
