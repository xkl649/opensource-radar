## Installation

```

## Available Skills

### `/swapper-deposit` — Direct Deposit

Deposit and bridge funds into wallets and DeFi protocols. Card, wallet, or crypto transfer — straight into the protocol.

- Direct deposits to any wallet address
- Cross-chain bridge transfers via Chainlink CCIP
- Protocol deposits — lending, staking, liquidity pools
- Fiat on-ramp — Mastercard, Visa, Apple Pay, Google Pay (170+ countries)

**Triggers when:**
- User asks to deposit, fund, top-up, or bridge assets
- Agent detects a wallet has insufficient funds mid-task
- User wants to convert fiat to crypto and deposit into DeFi
- User wants to fund a wallet before executing a strategy

**Example:**

```
User: "Deposit $100 USDC into Aave on Base"

Swapper Deposit Skill:
→ Chain: Base (8453)
→ Token: USDC
→ Protocol: Aave
→ Amount: $100
→ Opening deposit link...

✓ Deposit link generated. Confirm in your browser.
```

**Supported chains:** Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Fast, Solana, HyperEVM, BNB Chain, Avalanche

Swap tokens across chains and DEXs. Cross-chain swaps via Chainlink CCIP.

- Same-chain swaps across major DEXs
- Cross-chain swaps via CCIP

### `/swapper-wallet` — Wallet Management *(Coming Soon)*

Create, fund, and manage agent wallets.

## SDK Integration

For developers building apps who want to embed the deposit flow:

```bash
npm i @swapper-finance/deposit-sdk
```

```javascript
import { openSwapperModal } from "@swapper-finance/deposit-sdk";

openSwapperModal({
  integratorId: "your-integrator-id",
  dstChainId: "8453",
  dstTokenAddr: "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913",
  depositWalletAddress: "0xYourWalletAddress",
  styles: { themeMode: "dark" },
  supportedDepositOptions: ["transferCrypto", "depositWithCash"],
});
```

## Safety

- **Explicit confirmation** — every transaction requires user approval
- **Transparent fees** — slippage, gas, and risks surfaced before confirmation
- **Key security** — private keys are never stored or accessed
- Transactions are never auto-approved
