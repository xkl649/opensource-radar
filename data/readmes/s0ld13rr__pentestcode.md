**PentestCode is an autonomous pentesting agent for your terminal.** Point it at a target and it runs the tools, reads the output, updates its picture of the network, and decides what to do next — the way an operator would. A hard fork of [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) (MIT), stripped of the code-editing focus and rebuilt for offensive security.

> **Beta** — it holds up on real engagements and CTFs, but expect rough edges. [File an issue](https://github.com/s0ld13rr/pentestcode/issues) when something breaks; that's what makes it better.

## What it does

One instruction in, a full attack chain out:

```
you: "pentest 10.10.10.5, goal is domain admin"
```

| Stage | What the agent does |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Scan** | `nmap -sS -p-` finds 7 open ports and parses the XML straight into engagement state |
| **Recognize** | Ports 88 + 389 → Domain Controller. Fans out three enumerators in parallel (SMB, LDAP, HTTP) |
| **Enumerate** | Null SMB session → writable share. LDAP → user list. Gobuster → web dirs |
| **Attack** | AS-REP roast → crackable hash → first valid credential |
| **Spray** | That credential sprayed across SMB, WinRM, LDAP and RDP on every known host |
| **Exploit** | WinRM foothold → post-exploit agent dumps SAM / LSA / DPAPI |
| **Result** | Domain admin hash in hand — every step recorded with its evidence chain |

It's methodical where people get lazy: it sprays every credential against every service on every host, and it doesn't forget to check things. Everything it learns lands in a structured state you can query mid-run with `/status`, `/vulns`, or `/creds`.

```

Works with 20+ providers through [ai-sdk](https://github.com/vercel/ai) — Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Azure, AWS Bedrock, Ollama, and more.

## How it works

Two things separate PentestCode from a pentester prompt pasted into a chat window: **a team of agents** and **a memory they share**.

### A team, not a monologue

The design follows the strategist-coordinator model from [HPTSA research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02246) — a 4.3× improvement over a single agent:

```
                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │   pentest   │  strategist / coordinator
                    │   (lead)    │  plans, dispatches, tracks state
                    └──────┬──────┘
           ┌───────┬───────┼───────┬───────┐
           ▼       ▼       ▼       ▼       ▼
        ┌──────┐┌──────┐┌──────┐┌──────┐┌──────┐
        │recon ││scan- ││explo-││iden- ││post- │
        │      ││ner   ││iter  ││tity  ││explo │  ... + 7 more
        └──────┘└──────┘└──────┘└──────┘└──────┘
```

The lead agent (`pentest`) breaks the engagement into tasks and dispatches specialist subagents in parallel — each with its own system prompt, tool permissions, and domain knowledge. **13 agents in all:** recon, scanner, enumerator, exploiter, identity (AD/Kerberos), infrastructure (SNMP/IPMI/databases), webapp (OWASP Top 10), post-exploit, exploit-dev, critic (false-positive checker), reporter, plus hidden agents for context compression and session management.

### A memory they all share

When the scanner finds a port, the enumerator sees it instantly — because every agent reads from and writes to one structured **engagement state**:

- **Hosts & services** — IP, hostname, OS, ports, service versions, banners
- **Vulnerabilities** — severity, status (suspected / confirmed / exploited), evidence chain, confidence score
- **Credentials** — username, hash/password, type, domain, what they unlock
- **Access** — who holds shell/RDP/DB on which host, at what privilege level
- **Relationships** — an entity graph (EXPLOITED_VIA, CREDENTIAL_FROM, ADMIN_OF, PIVOT_TO, …)
- **AD domain model** — domain controllers, trusts, admins, password policy, GPOs
- **Network segments** — VLANs, reachable networks, pivot hosts
- **Attack paths** — cost-based Dijkstra + Yen's K-shortest routes through the relationship graph

State survives the session: close the terminal, come back tomorrow, and the agent resumes where it stopped. Alongside it, a human-readable `findings.md` logs every vulnerability, credential, and access gain with timestamps — `tail -f` it to watch the engagement unfold.

## Tools

18 built-in pentest tools beyond bash. Parser tools are mandatory: after running nmap the agent must pipe the output through `nmap_parse` rather than grep the XML by hand, so every finding reaches the engagement state.

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `nmap_parse` | Parse nmap XML → auto-populate hosts/services |
| `nuclei_parse` | Parse Nuclei JSON → create vulns with severity |
| `cme_parse` | Parse NetExec output → update creds/access/hosts |
| `gobuster_parse` | Parse dir brute output → classify findings |
| `bloodhound_parse` | Parse SharpHound JSON → populate AD model |
| `sqlmap_parse` | Parse sqlmap output → extract injection points |
| `xss_detect` | Analyze responses for reflected/stored XSS |
| `jwt_analyze` | Decode JWT, check alg:none/weak HMAC/expiry |
| `cred_spray` | Plan credential spray across all discovered services |
| `scope_check` | CIDR/wildcard scope validation |
| `attack_path_suggest` | Cost-based path finding through the relationship graph |
| `tunnel_manage` | Plan SSH/chisel/ligolo tunnels, track live sessions |
| `phase_control` | Phase management with quality gates |
| `report_gen` | Generate markdown/JSON pentest reports |
| `state_update` | Record findings (30+ mutation types, batch mode) |
| `state_query` | Query engagement state (20+ query types) |

## Skills

19 curated knowledge packs, loaded on demand so they cost context only when relevant:

- **Phase checklists** (6) — what to do in each pentest phase
- **Service knowledge** (9) — SMB, SSH, FTP, DNS, databases, web servers, mail, Docker/K8s, CI/CD
- **Playbooks** (4) — infrastructure, Active Directory, web application, cloud

Skills are plain markdown. Add your own by dropping a `SKILL.md` into the skills directory — no code changes needed.

## Commands & modes

Drive a live session with slash commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/status` | Engagement dashboard — hosts, vulns, creds, phase |
| `/targets` | Host & service table |
| `/vulns` | Findings by severity |
| `/creds` | Discovered credentials |
| `/scope` | View/edit target scope |
| `/phase` | Phase management |
| `/mode` | Switch auto / free / guided |
| `/pause` | Pause on findings (never / always / checkpoint) |
| `/report` | Generate a pentest report |

And set how much rope the agent gets:

- **auto** — runs through the pentest phases autonomously, spawning subagents as needed
- **free** — no phase structure; responds to your requests directly (bypasses scope checks)
- **guided** — step by step; proposes each action and waits for approval

Modes combine with pause behavior — `auto` + `pause always` gives you autonomous execution that stops at every finding for review.

## Use cases

One toolkit across offensive security:

- **Penetration testing** — full methodology from recon to reporting
- **CTF competitions** — flag tracking, objective management, multi-target coordination
- **Bug bounty** — web app testing, API security, recon automation
- **Vulnerability research** — systematic enumeration and validation
- **Infrastructure security** — network service auditing, default-credential checks

## Configuration

Config lives at `.pentestcode/pentestcode.jsonc`:

```jsonc
{
  "provider": {
    "anthropic": {
      "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
    }
  }
}
```

Providers: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Azure, AWS Bedrock, Ollama, Together, Groq, Fireworks, DeepSeek, Mistral, and more via [ai-sdk](https://github.com/vercel/ai).

## Contributing

Bug reports from real usage are the most valuable thing you can send. Run PentestCode on a CTF box, an HTB machine, or an authorized pentest, and when something goes wrong — it loops, misses an obvious path, chokes on tool output, or wastes tokens — open an issue with:

1. What you were testing (target type, not sensitive details)
2. What went wrong
3. The `findings.md` and/or relevant session output

Feature requests and PRs are welcome too. The codebase is TypeScript on the Effect library — see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for architecture.
