[![#2 Swift Repository Of The Day](https://trendshift.io/api/badge/trendshift/repositories/57307/daily?language=Swift)](https://trendshift.io/repositories/57307)

A **sudoless Apple Silicon system monitor** — a native SwiftUI dashboard **and** a full
menu-bar suite — with first-class **ANE (Neural Engine)**, **Media Engine**, and
**memory-bandwidth** tracking that Activity Monitor and terminal monitors don't surface.

Born from wanting to *see* how on-device AI and media workloads drive the Apple Silicon
accelerators — and grown into a daily-driver monitor that can stand in for iStat Menus.

**New in 4.0 — it watches your *other* machines too.** A headless Mac mini, a Linux GPU box under
the desk, a rented cloud instance: run a small agent there and it joins the same dashboard, over an
encrypted, paired connection. Remote Macs keep the full treatment, **Neural Engine included**.

*Featured on [AAPL Ch.](https://applech2.com/archives/20260620-siliconscope-apple-silicon-mac-system-monitor.html) (JP) and [ifun.de](https://www.ifun.de/siliconscope-ueberwacht-apple-ki-neural-engine-und-speicher-in-echtzeit-282222/) (DE).*

![SiliconScope dashboard with the Replay scrubber](docs/img/dashboard.png)

*One M1 Max under a real load — LM Studio generating on `gemma-4-12b`. The workload classifier reads **ANE (CoreML)**, the GPU is at 97 % and 39 W, memory bandwidth is 223 GB/s against the chip's 400 GB/s ceiling, and the CPU card is outlined red because the P-cluster is **thermally throttled** — 2272 of 3228 MHz, stated as a fact rather than an alarm. Colour is spent only where something needs attention: amber on memory pressure, red on the throttle, neutral everywhere else. The bar along the bottom is **Replay** (new in 3.0): every metric is recorded, so you can scrub back through a session like a DVR.*

### Menu bar — every metric, iStat-style

Pin any card to its own menu-bar item — **CPU · GPU · Memory · Network · SSD · Sensors · Battery** — each with a live glyph and a rich dropdown. Every item chooses its own **style** (bars · history graph · two lines · single value · icon) and which readings it draws, so a metric can even appear twice: CPU as bars *and* as a graph. All sudoless.

![The per-metric menu-bar suite](docs/img/menubar.png)

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/img/menubar-gpu.png" width="250" alt="GPU / Media / Neural dropdown">

  <img src="docs/img/menubar-cockpit.png" width="250" alt="Combined SS cockpit — workload, all engines, trends, top processes">
</p>

*The richest dropdowns. **GPU / Media / Neural** — GPU, GPU memory, ANE and Media as live meters plus a four-line 60-second trend. **Sensors** — per-unit temperatures from real **E-Core / P-Core / GPU / Memory** sensors (curated SMC keys per chip generation, M1–M5; HID fallback elsewhere). **SS cockpit** — the whole machine in one dropdown: workload verdict, every engine, 60-second trends, and the top processes.*

![Measuring a local model's speed and efficiency](docs/img/benchmark.png)

*On-demand benchmark: "Measure tok/s" runs one short generation and reports the model's decode speed and energy efficiency — **tokens/sec · tokens/Wh** — stored per model.*

## New in 4.0

### 🛰 Fleet — your other machines, in the same dashboard

Run an agent on a remote box and it shows up in a **Devices** sidebar beside **This Mac**.
Machines on your LAN are discovered automatically (mDNS) — no IP configuration.

![The Fleet overview — every machine on one screen](docs/img/fleet-overview.png)

*Three machines at a glance. Each tile pairs **GPU + VRAM** and **CPU + RAM** on one axis,
plus **ANE + memory bandwidth** on Apple Silicon — the tinted metric word matches its line, so
no legend is needed. The bottom line of a tile is the **decode rate its runtime measured**,
with how long ago: the Ubuntu box reached **262 tok/s**, both Macs **28 tok/s**. A rate dims
once it stops describing the present. This Mac is always the first tile.*

- **A remote Mac renders in the exact dashboard the local one uses** — E/P cores, GPU,
  **ANE**, Media, memory bandwidth, power, fans. As far as I know, no other tool shows a
  **remote Mac's Neural Engine**.
- **A Linux/NVIDIA box gets a GPU-centric view** — utilization, VRAM, power against the card's
  limit, temperature, which processes hold VRAM, and any **Ollama** models loaded. It doesn't
  pretend a 3090 has E-cores.

![A remote Mac in the full local dashboard, ANE included](docs/img/fleet-remote-mac.png)

*A headless M1 Air, seen from another Mac: **4E+4P** cores, GPU/Media/**ANE est.**, the real memory
split (**wired 1.0 / active 2.7 / compressed 0.5 GB**, pressure 19%) — and Sensors correctly reporting
**fanless** instead of inventing a fan reading. Cards a wire agent can't fill are omitted, not faked.*

![A Linux GPU box with VRAM holders and Ollama models](docs/img/fleet-linux.png)

*The same app, a different machine class. An RTX 3090 box: **35 / 390 W** against the card's limit,
**18.7 / 24 GB VRAM**, which processes are holding it (a Python venv at **17.9 GB**), and the Ollama
models on disk. No E-cores, no ANE — because it has neither.*

Every connection is **TLS-encrypted and token-authenticated**, and the viewer pins the agent's
certificate the first time it connects, so a re-keyed or spoofed agent is refused rather than
silently trusted.

![This Mac unchanged, with the new Devices sidebar](docs/img/fleet-sidebar.png)

*Nothing about single-Mac use changes — the dashboard is the same one, with a collapsible **Devices**
sidebar added. Collapse it and you're back to 3.x exactly.*

#### Install an agent

One URL, every platform — systemd on Linux, a LaunchAgent on macOS:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kennss/SiliconScope/main/scripts/install-agent.sh | sh
```

The Mac agent needs **no sudo**, so this finishes unattended over `ssh`. Each installer ends by
printing one `sscope://pair…` link — paste it into **Add machine…** in the app and the machine is
added *and* paired in a single step.

On a Mac you actually sit at, you don't need the agent at all: **Settings → Share this Mac**.

> **Headless Mac?** Enable **System Settings → General → Sharing → Remote Login** first — you can't
> install anything on it otherwise. **Off your LAN** (Tailscale, VPN, cloud)? mDNS can't reach it, so
> add it by address in **Add machine…**; prefer Tailscale or an SSH tunnel over exposing the port
> publicly.

**To remove an agent** — on that machine, run the installer with `--uninstall` (`curl -fsSL …/install-agent.sh | sh -s -- --uninstall`, or `sh install-agent.sh --uninstall` if you have it locally). It stops the service and deletes the binary, token, certificate and keychain. Then, on the viewer Mac, right-click the machine in the Fleet sidebar → **Forget pairing**.

## New in 3.0

### 🧠 Process Inspector — per-process metrics, sudoless

Click any process to open the Inspector. It shows what Activity Monitor can't:
**CPU (P/E split) · IPC · per-process power (W) · memory · disk** — each with a live
sparkline — and the one signal nobody else surfaces per process: **Neural-Engine memory**.
See exactly which app is on the ANE, and how much it's holding.

![Process Inspector — per-process CPU, IPC, power, and Neural-Engine memory](docs/img/inspector.png)

*An on-device transcription app running live (right): 65% CPU at **2.43 IPC**, **0.64 W**, and **762 MB
of Neural-Engine memory** — the ANE footprint no other monitor shows per process. Accelerators
that macOS only reports system-wide (GPU / ANE-power / Media / bandwidth) are labeled as such —
no faked per-process numbers.*

### ⏺ Record & Replay — a DVR for your Mac's metrics

Hit **Record** and SiliconScope streams every metric — CPU, GPU, ANE, Media, bandwidth, power,
sensors, processes — to a compact `.ssrec` file. Then replay the whole dashboard with
**play / pause / scrub / speed**, so you can catch a spike that's already gone by the time you
look at it. It all stays on your Mac; export a recording to share or diff a run later.

![The Replay transport — play / pause / step, scrub, speed, and Save](docs/img/replaybar.png)

*The Replay transport: play / pause / step, scrub the timeline, change speed, and Save the recording.*

## Why I built it

I built SiliconScope while developing **[Spectalo](https://spectalo.calidalab.ai/)**, an on-device AI video player. To see how
it was actually driving the chip, I ended up running two monitors at once — and neither one
fit:

- **asitop / NeoAsitop** had the chip-level numbers, but the TUI was rough to look at and thin
  on detail.
- **btop** was gorgeous and dense, yet blind to exactly what I needed — **ANE (Neural Engine),
  the Media Engine, and memory bandwidth.**

Keeping both open side by side was painful, and a waste of screen space. I started to fork
NeoAsitop and btop to patch the gaps — then decided to do it properly instead: **one native,
good-looking GUI** that surfaces the Apple-Silicon-specific signals and that a normal person,
not just a terminal dweller, can actually read.

So I built it.

And once it existed, I realized it was finally time to part with **iStat Menus** — my daily
monitor for years. That's what **2.0** is: the release where SiliconScope grew the full
menu-bar suite, per-unit sensors, and battery health it needed to take iStat's place on my
own Mac.

## Install

**Homebrew** — the easiest way:

```sh
brew install --cask siliconscope
```

Or grab the DMG: **[⬇ Download the latest DMG](https://github.com/kennss/SiliconScope/releases/latest)**, then:

1. Open the downloaded `SiliconScope-*.dmg`
2. Drag **SiliconScope** into **Applications**
3. Launch it

Signed with a Developer ID and **notarized by Apple** — it opens with no Gatekeeper
prompt. Requires **macOS 14+ on Apple Silicon**. It **updates itself** from here on
(Sparkle) — this is the last DMG you download by hand.

> **Pre-release macOS is not supported.** This project has one Mac and it runs the release
> version, so a developer beta cannot be reproduced or verified here. Reports from one are
> still welcome and have already been useful — SiliconScope reads private IOReport interfaces
> that Apple renames between builds, and a rename found early is a rename fixed before it
> reaches everyone — but fixes land when the OS ships, not against a beta seed.

Prefer to build it yourself? See [Build & run](#build--run).

## Highlights

- **Process Inspector** *(new in 3.0)* — focus one process for CPU (P/E split), IPC,
  per-process **power (W)**, memory, disk, and **Neural-Engine memory** — all sudoless
- **Record & Replay** *(new in 3.0)* — record every metric to a `.ssrec` file and replay the
  dashboard with **play / pause / scrub / speed**, like a DVR
- **AI Workload view** — a bottleneck classifier (*bandwidth-bound* / *compute-bound* /
  *thermal-throttled* / *memory-pressured*), judged against each chip's spec bandwidth
  ceiling — answers "what's limiting my local LLM right now?"
- **E-core / P-core split** — per-cluster utilization + real DVFS frequency
- **GPU** — utilization, power, frequency
- **ANE & Media Engine** — Neural-Engine power and media-codec bandwidth (the differentiators)
- **Memory bandwidth** — CPU / GPU / Media / total GB/s (the local-LLM bottleneck signal)
- **Memory** — Wired / Active / Compressed / Free stacked bar + macOS **memory-pressure** alerts
- **Network** ↑/↓ and **Disk** read/write + free space, with live graphs
- **Per-unit temperatures** — real **E-Core / P-Core / GPU / Memory** sensors via curated
  per-generation SMC keys (M1–M5; HID fallback on others), fan RPM, thermal pressure, and
  **GPU throttle detection** (clock held below its rolling peak under pressure)
- **Battery** — charge state, **health %, cycle count, condition** (AppleSmartBattery)
- **Power** — per-domain CPU / GPU / ANE / DRAM / SoC, plus battery
- **Processes** — sort, filter, kill, and **click to inspect** (in-card scroll)
- **Per-metric menu-bar items** — pin CPU / GPU / Memory / Network / SSD / Sensors / Battery
  each to its own menu-bar glyph + dropdown (plus the combined "SS" cockpit glyph)
- **Auto-update** — built-in Sparkle updater; "Check for Updates…" in the menu
- **No `sudo` required.**

## Build & run

Requires macOS on Apple Silicon and the Xcode toolchain.

```bash
xcrun swift run SiliconScope        # SwiftUI GUI (dashboard + menu bar)
xcrun swift run -q sscope-cli       # data-layer verification CLI
xcrun swift build                   # build everything
scripts/build-app.sh                # create dist/SiliconScope.app locally
open dist/SiliconScope.app          # launch the local app bundle
```

> Use `xcrun`. A non-Xcode `swift` (e.g. swiftly) may not match the macOS SDK and
> will fail with `Failed to build module 'Foundation'`.

## How it works (all sudoless)

| Data | Source |
|---|---|
| Power (CPU/GPU/ANE/DRAM), residency, memory bandwidth | private **IOReport** framework (symbols resolved at runtime via dyld) |
| CPU usage | `host_processor_info` ticks (matches Activity Monitor) |
| CPU/GPU frequency | IOReport `CPU Stats` / `GPU Stats` × IORegistry DVFS table |
| Memory / swap / pressure | `host_statistics64`, `sysctl` |
| Temperatures (per-unit) | curated per-generation **SMC** FourCC keys + **HID** (`IOHIDEventSystem`) fallback |
| Fans, thermal pressure | **SMC** via IOKit |
| Network / Disk | `getifaddrs` / SystemConfiguration, mounted-volume capacities |
| Battery (charge + health/cycles/condition) | IOPowerSources + **AppleSmartBattery** (IORegistry) |
| Processes | `libproc` |

### Deep dive — the hard parts

Most of these are private/undocumented APIs with no SDK stub. The patterns below are the
reason people clone this repo — each one is a gotcha that cost a day to figure out.

#### 1. IOReport without `sudo` — and without an SDK stub

`IOReport` carries the good stuff (per-domain power, cluster residency, memory bandwidth) and
needs **no root**. The catch: there's no `.tbd` stub in the SDK, so `-framework IOReport`
fails to link. The fix is to **declare the symbols yourself** and let dyld resolve them from
the shared cache at runtime:

```swift
// Package.swift — link the final binary with dynamic_lookup
linkerSettings: [.unsafeFlags(["-Xlinker", "-undefined", "-Xlinker", "dynamic_lookup"])]
```
```c
// Sources/CIOReport/include/ktop_ioreport.h — your own extern decls (one isolated C target)
extern CFDictionaryRef IOReportCreateSamples(IOReportSubscriptionRef, CFMutableDictionaryRef, CFTypeRef);
extern CFDictionaryRef IOReportCreateSamplesDelta(CFDictionaryRef prev, CFDictionaryRef cur, CFTypeRef);
```

Sampling is **two snapshots a short interval apart (~175 ms), then `…SamplesDelta`** — power
and residency are deltas, not instantaneous values. All private declarations live in one C
target (`CIOReport`) so the unsafe surface is contained and the Swift side stays clean.

> Trade-off: private API ⇒ **no App Store sandbox**. Self-distribute (sign + notarize). The
> `dynamic_lookup` flag is broad — it defers *all* undefined symbols to runtime, so a real
> link typo only surfaces on launch. Worth knowing.

#### 2. Per-unit temperatures: curated SMC keys, HID fallback

On Apple Silicon a naive SMC "scan all `T…` keys" returns almost nothing useful, and the HID
sensor set (`IOHIDEventSystemClient`, `PrimaryUsagePage 0xff00` / usage `5`) returns *many*
sensors but with cryptic PMU names (`PMU tdie3`, `tcal`). iStat-style friendly names come from
a **hand-curated, per-generation map of SMC FourCC keys read directly** (not scanned):

```swift
// SensorCatalog.swift — detected from the CPU brand string (M1…M5)
cpu([("Tp09","E-Core 1"), ("Tp01","P-Core 1"), ("Tp05","P-Core 2"), …]) +
gpu([("Tg05","GPU 1"), …]) + mem([("Tm02","Memory 1"), …])
```

The keys are near-arbitrary and change every generation (tables adapted from
[Stats](https://github.com/exelban/stats)). Fallback chain: **curated SMC → HID set → SMC
scan** (Intel). Variants (Pro/Max/Ultra) need no special-casing — absent keys simply don't
read back and are skipped.

#### 3. E/P-core split + real DVFS frequency

Topology from `sysctl hw.perflevel0/1`; per-core utilization from `host_processor_info` ticks
(the same source Activity Monitor uses). Frequency is residency-weighted: IOReport gives time
spent in each DVFS state, and the **state→MHz table comes from IORegistry** (`voltage-states*`),
so the reported MHz is what the cluster actually ran at, not a nominal max.

#### 4. ANE & memory bandwidth (with an honest caveat)

The IOReport **Energy Model** group exposes per-domain power including the Neural Engine, and
the bandwidth channels give CPU/GPU/Media/total GB/s. **ANE "usage" is a power-normalized
estimate** — Apple doesn't expose ANE occupancy, so it's labeled as an estimate rather than
faked as a percentage.

#### 5. Dynamic per-metric menu-bar items (AppKit, not SwiftUI)

Each metric becomes its own menu-bar item you can toggle. SwiftUI's `MenuBarExtra` can't do
this: a conditional scene won't compile (SceneBuilder has no `buildOptional`), and
`MenuBarExtra(isInserted:)` triggers a main-menu update **loop** (beachball). The working
answer is AppKit — an `NSStatusItem` + `NSPopover` per enabled metric, reconciled against the
toggles each tick. Live glyphs are drawn to `NSImage` (a live SwiftUI `label:` collapses to
zero width in a status item).

#### 6. Auto-update in a pure-SPM app

Sparkle via SPM, with **no Xcode project**: `package.sh` embeds `Sparkle.framework`, fixes the
rpath, signs nested helpers deep→shallow, then runs `generate_appcast`. The feed is the
**latest GitHub release's `appcast.xml`** (`…/releases/latest/download/appcast.xml`), so each
release just attaches the DMG + appcast and the app updates itself.

#### 7. Per-process metrics — including ANE memory — without `sudo`

The Process Inspector's numbers come from **`proc_pid_rusage(pid, RUSAGE_INFO_V6, …)`** — a
*public* SDK call (no entitlement, no root for processes you own). `rusage_info_v6` carries far
more than CPU time: `ri_instructions` / `ri_cycles` (real **IPC**), `ri_energy_nj` (per-process
**power**, in nanojoules), `ri_user_ptime` (the **P-core** share), disk bytes, wakeups — and the
one that matters most here, **`ri_neural_footprint`: per-process Neural-Engine memory.** That's
the only genuinely per-process ANE signal Apple exposes, so the Inspector shows ANE *memory* per
app but keeps GPU / ANE-power / Media / bandwidth labeled **system-wide** (Apple doesn't
attribute those to a pid — and faking it would be worse than honest). Counters are turned into
rates by delta-over-dt between ticks; a `ri_proc_start_abstime` check guards against pid reuse.

## Not on the Mac App Store

SiliconScope uses private (un-entitled) APIs (IOReport, SMC, HID), so it cannot be
sandboxed/notarized for the App Store. Distribute directly. This is the same
trade-off as NeoAsitop, macmon, mactop, and Stats.

## Contributing

PRs welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). The most useful contribution right now:
**verify the per-chip temperature keys.** The M1 table is hardware-validated; **M2–M5 are
adapted but unverified**. On an M2/M3/M4/M5, run `xcrun swift run -q sscope-cli --sensors`
(+ `sysctl hw.model machdep.cpu.brand_string`) and open an issue with the output.

### Contributors

**Two of the chips SiliconScope reads correctly are chips it has never run on.** That is not a
figure of speech: this project owns an M1 Max, and M4 Max and M5 Max support exists only because
two people worked on their own hardware carefully enough that nothing had to be guessed.

- **[@fparrav](https://github.com/fparrav)** — M4 Max, **diagnosed and fixed**. He found that
  `AMC Stats` enumerates but refuses to subscribe — a different failure from the one already open —
  and then wrote the fix himself: the PMP histogram fallback that reads per-requestor bandwidth out
  of a residency histogram when the classic path is gone, plus a `--bandwidth` diagnostic, unit
  tests and the channel-map documentation
  ([#29](https://github.com/kennss/SiliconScope/pull/29), +626 lines). **That fallback is the
  foundation the M5 fix was later built on** — memory bandwidth and the Media Engine work on both
  generations because of his code.
- **[@ben0112](https://github.com/ben0112)** — M5 Max, measured to a standard this project could
  not have reached alone. The bandwidth path again (the group renamed `PMP` → `PMP0`), the AMCC
  bucket floor, and then the whole perf-level story: a chip with **no Efficiency cores**, the
  device-tree cluster map that now decides how *every* Mac splits its cores, and the rail→cluster
  mapping — each experiment repeated three times, with the watts cross-checked against the bare
  rail so double-counting could be ruled out rather than assumed
  ([#30](https://github.com/kennss/SiliconScope/issues/30)). His measurements are written up in
  [`docs/ioreport-channels.md`](docs/ioreport-channels.md).

And parts of the app are other people's work outright:

- **[@durul](https://github.com/durul)** — **named this project.** It shipped as "WhisPlayInfo",
  a companion utility's name for something that had already outgrown it; he proposed
  **SiliconScope** in [#4](https://github.com/kennss/SiliconScope/issues/4), argued it from what the
  app actually is, and it has been the name ever since. He also wrote the AI-workload bottleneck
  classifier, the GPU throttle detector and compact GPU menu-bar mode
  ([#2](https://github.com/kennss/SiliconScope/pull/2)) — the bottleneck verdict on the dashboard is
  his — plus the local app-bundle build script ([#3](https://github.com/kennss/SiliconScope/pull/3)).
- **[@davidarny](https://github.com/davidarny)** — unified the popover action buttons into one
  style, made Settings focus when opened from a popover, inset the app icon to Apple's grid, and
  fixed Sparkle embedding in the dev build ([#7](https://github.com/kennss/SiliconScope/pull/7),
  [#8](https://github.com/kennss/SiliconScope/pull/8),
  [#9](https://github.com/kennss/SiliconScope/pull/9)).
- **[@Collinw24](https://github.com/Collinw24)** — oMLX inference-server support, and a
  `ProcessSampler` truncation fix found along the way
  ([#26](https://github.com/kennss/SiliconScope/pull/26)).
- **[@zhangchen456](https://github.com/zhangchen456)** — the "Show Dock icon" setting, which is what
  lets SiliconScope run as a pure menu-bar utility.

And some of it is finding numbers that were wrong without looking wrong:

- **[@YuriNachos](https://github.com/YuriNachos)** — five merged fixes in four days, every one of
  them in a value the dashboard was already displaying without complaint: `fpe2` SMC keys floored to
  whole units, IOReport's `INT64_MIN` "unpopulated" sentinel summed as if it were a real byte count,
  a used fraction that went negative on network volumes, and two path rules that read a *username*
  as an AI runtime ([#38](https://github.com/kennss/SiliconScope/pull/38),
  [#39](https://github.com/kennss/SiliconScope/pull/39),
  [#40](https://github.com/kennss/SiliconScope/pull/40),
  [#41](https://github.com/kennss/SiliconScope/pull/41),
  [#42](https://github.com/kennss/SiliconScope/pull/42)). Every one arrived with tests larger than
  the fix. These are the hardest bugs to notice from the inside — nothing looks broken.

Bug reports that come with a measurement are worth more than most patches, and several of the
entries above started as exactly that.

  but loses to the GPU on 4B+ LLMs. Shared by
