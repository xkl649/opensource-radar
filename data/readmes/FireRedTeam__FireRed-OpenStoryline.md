**FireRed-OpenStoryline** turns complex video creation into natural, intuitive conversations. Designed with both accessibility and enterprise-grade reliability in mind, FireRed-OpenStoryline makes video creation easy and friendly to beginners and creative enthusiasts alike.
> Deriving from the saying "A single spark can start a prairie fire", the name FireRed represents our vision: to spread our SOTA capabilities—honed in real-world scenarios—like sparks across the wilderness, igniting the imagination of developers worldwide to reshape the future of AI together.

## ✨ Key Features
- 🌐 **Smart Media Search & Organization**: Automatically searches online and downloads images and video clips that match your requirements. Performs clip segmentation and content understanding based on your thematic media.
- ✍️ **Intelligent Script Generation**: Combines user themes, visual understanding, and emotion recognition to automatically construct storylines and context-aware narration. Features built-in Few-shot style transfer capabilities, allowing users to define specific copy styles (e.g., product reviews, casual vlogs) via reference text, achieving precise replication of tone, rhythm, and sentence structure.
- 🎵 **Intelligent Music, Voiceover & Font Recommendations**: Supports personal playlist imports and auto-recommends BGM based on content and mood, featuring smart beat-syncing. Simply describe the desired tone—e.g., "Restrained," "Emotional," or "Documentary-style"—and the system matches suitable voiceovers and fonts to ensure a cohesive aesthetic.
- 💬 **Conversational Refinement**: Rapidly cut, swap, or resequence clips. Edit scripts and fine-tune visual details—including color, font, stroke, and position. All edits are performed exclusively via natural language prompts with immediate results.
- ⚡**Editing Skill Archiving**: Save your complete editing workflow as a custom Skill. Simply swap the media and apply the corresponding Skill to instantly replicate the style, enabling efficient batch creation.

## NEWS

* 🎬 **2026-04-02**: Added the **AI Transition Generation** feature, which automatically creates transition shots based on the ending frame of one clip, the opening frame of the next, and a natural-language description, making scene transitions smoother and the narrative more coherent.
* 🚀 **2026-03-22**: Introduced an **ASR-based rough cut skill for speech videos**, enabling automatic removal of filler words, disfluencies, and repeated sentences, with timestamp-aligned segmentation for cleaner and more efficient speech editing workflows.
* 🔥 **2026-03-12**: Integrated with **OpenClaw**, adding two OpenClaw Skills — `openstoryline-install` and `openstoryline-use` — covering the initial installation/first-run workflow and the actual usage workflow, respectively. Also added Skill usage instructions for **Claude Code**, making it easier for **Claude Code** to install and invoke the project in accordance with the repository guidelines.
* **2026-02-10**: FireRed-OpenStoryline was officially open-sourced.

> <sub>
> ⚠️ Note: AI transitions rely on third-party AIGC video generation services, and <b>the cost is relatively high</b>. Due to variations in source material quality, prompts, and model performance, the generated results are somewhat unpredictable. It is recommended to enable this feature only when needed.

## 🤖 Use Through an Agent

FireRed-OpenStoryline supports usage through Agent Skills.
We provide two Skills:

* `openstoryline-install`: for installation, configuration, and first-run verification.
* `openstoryline-use`: for starting the service and running the actual video editing workflow.

### OpenClaw

Just tell OpenClaw: “I want to try OpenStoryline. Help me install the required Skills,” and it will automatically trigger the installation.
If the installation runs into problems, use the following commands to install them manually:

```bash
openclaw skills install openstoryline-install
openclaw skills install openstoryline-use
```

If your current OpenClaw version does not support `openclaw skills install`, or if installation still fails, you can use ClawHub instead:

```bash
npx clawhub install openstoryline-install
npx clawhub install openstoryline-use
```

Once installed, you only need to send your media assets to OpenClaw, and it can help you complete the entire process from installing FireRed-OpenStoryline to generating the final video.

### Claude Code

This repository comes with built-in Claude Code Skills.
If you start Claude Code from the **root directory of this repository**, you can use the project-level Skills included in the repo directly. Claude Code can then help you install and use FireRed-OpenStoryline.

```bash
/openstoryline-install
/openstoryline-use
```

If you want to install these two Skills into your own global Claude Code configuration, run:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -R .claude/skills/openstoryline-install ~/.claude/skills/
cp -R .claude/skills/openstoryline-use ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Other Compatible Agents (Experimental)

These Skills are based on an open Agent Skills format, so in theory they can also be installed into other compatible agents.
For example, you can install them into Codex via the Skills CLI:

```bash
npx skills add FireRedTeam/FireRed-OpenStoryline --skill openstoryline-install --agent codex
npx skills add FireRedTeam/FireRed-OpenStoryline --skill openstoryline-use --agent codex
```

Or use the commands below with the `--global` flag to install these Skills into the user-level directory so they are available across projects:

```bash
npx skills add FireRedTeam/FireRed-OpenStoryline --skill openstoryline-install --global
npx skills add FireRedTeam/FireRed-OpenStoryline --skill openstoryline-use --global
```

## 📦 Install
### 1. Clone repository
```
# If git is not installed, refer to the official website for installation: https://git-scm.com/install/
# Or manually download the code
git clone https://github.com/FireRedTeam/FireRed-OpenStoryline.git
cd FireRed-OpenStoryline
```
### 2. Create a virtual environment

Install Conda according to the official guide (Miniforge is recommended, it is suggested to check the option to automatically configure environment variables during installation): https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html
