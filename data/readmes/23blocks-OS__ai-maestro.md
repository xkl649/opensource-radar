# AI Maestro

*I was running 35 AI agents across multiple terminals and became the human mailman between them. So I built AI Maestro.*

**The OS for AI-first organizations — orchestrate any AI agent with persistent memory, agent-to-agent messaging, and multi-machine support.**

## The Story

I gave an AI agent a real task — not autocomplete, a real engineering problem. It checked the code, read the logs, queried the database, and came back with the answer. That was the moment. *This thing can actually work.*

Within a week I was running 35 agents across terminals. They were productive, but they couldn't talk to each other. I became the human message bus — copying context from one terminal, pasting into another. I was the bottleneck in my own AI team.

**So I built AI Maestro** — one dashboard to see every agent, on every machine, with persistent memory and direct agent-to-agent communication. Today I run 80+ agents across multiple computers, building real companies with them every day.

**What makes this different:**
- **Works with any AI agent** — Claude Code, Codex, Aider, Cursor, OpenClaw, Hermes, Droid, or any terminal-based agent. We don't lock you in.
- **Multi-machine from day one** — Peer mesh network with no central server. Nobody else does this.
- **Agents that communicate** — The Agent Messaging Protocol (AMP) lets agents coordinate directly. You orchestrate, they collaborate.

## Features

Every feature was born from running a real AI-first organization. We built them in the order we needed them.

### One Dashboard

*I had 35 terminals and couldn't tell which was which.*

See and manage all your AI agents in one place. Create agents from the UI with a guided wizard, organize them with smart naming (`project-backend-api` becomes a 3-level tree with auto-coloring), and switch between any agent with a click. Four deployment modes: **tmux** (local), **Docker** (containerized), **AWS EC2** (dedicated instance), and **AWS ECS Fargate** (serverless). Auto-discovers tmux sessions, Docker containers, cloud deployments, and standalone agents.

### Any Machine

*My Mac Mini was sitting there idle. What if I ran agents on that too?*

A peer mesh network where every machine is equal. Add a computer, it joins the mesh. Every agent on every machine, visible from one dashboard. Use each machine for what it's best at — Mac for iOS builds, Linux for Docker, cloud for heavy compute. **No central server required.**

### Agent Messaging

*I was the mailman — copying messages between agents because they couldn't talk to each other.*

The [Agent Messaging Protocol (AMP)](https://agentmessaging.org) gives your agents email-like communication. Priority levels, message types, cryptographic signatures, and push notifications. Tell your agent *"send a message to backend about the deployment"* — it just works. Agents coordinate directly while you manage the big picture.

**Before AMP:** You copy research from one terminal, paste into another, repeat 50 times a day.
**With AMP:** *"Research agent, send your findings to the writing agent."* Done.

### Gateways

*A friend in Singapore wanted his agents to talk to mine. But I didn't want to give him access to my network.*

Connect your AI agents to [Slack](https://github.com/23blocks-OS/aimaestro-gateways), Discord, Email, and WhatsApp through organizational gateways. Smart routing (`@AIM:agent-name`), thread-aware responses, and content security with 34 prompt injection patterns detected at the gateway — before any agent sees the message.

### Persistent Memory

*Every morning, my agents woke up with amnesia.*

Three layers of intelligence that grow over time: **Memory** (agents remember past conversations and decisions), **Code Graph** (interactive visualization of your entire codebase with delta indexing), and **Documentation** (auto-generated, searchable docs from your code). Agents get smarter the longer they work with you.

### Work Coordination

*Talking isn't working. I needed agents to coordinate on actual deliverables.*

Assemble agents into teams, run meetings in split-pane war rooms, and track tasks on a full Kanban board with drag-and-drop, dependencies, and 5 status columns. Cross-machine teams work seamlessly. This is project management for your AI workforce.

### Agent Identity

*At 80 agents, they all looked the same.*

Custom avatars, personality profiles, and visual presence for every agent. When an agent has a face and a role, you instinctively assign it the right work — just like a real team.

### Agent Deployment

*One agent on my laptop. Another on EC2. A third on Fargate. All in the same dashboard.*

Four ways to run agents, each for a different need:

| Mode | What | Best For |
|------|------|----------|
| **tmux** | Direct terminal sessions on your machine | Local development, zero setup |
| **Docker** | Containerized agents with resource limits | Isolation, reproducibility, multi-project |
| **AWS EC2** | Dedicated Graviton instance with native install, Nginx + SSL | Always-on agents, SSH access, persistent workloads |
| **AWS ECS Fargate** | Serverless containers, auto-built Docker image | Burst scaling, zero maintenance, pay-per-use |

Cloud agents are Terraform-managed. EC2 installs Node.js, tmux, and AI CLIs directly on ARM64 hardware (no Docker overhead). ECS auto-builds your Docker image, pushes to ECR, and runs on Fargate. Both deploy with one command from the dashboard or CLI.

```bash
# EC2: dedicated instance with SSL
aimaestro-agent.sh create my-api --ec2 \
  --domain api.example.com --ssl-email admin@example.com --key-name my-key

# ECS Fargate: serverless (auto-builds image)
aimaestro-agent.sh create worker --ecs
```

## The Agent Ecosystem

Every agent is built from five dimensions:

| | Dimension | What | Where |
|-|-----------|------|-------|
| **WHO** | Personality | Domain expertise, workflows, deliverables | [Agent Library](https://github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents) (150+) |
| **HOW** | Capabilities | Skills, scripts, CLI tools, Canvas | [Plugin Builder](https://github.com/23blocks-OS/ai-maestro-plugins) |
| **TRUST** | Identity | Cryptographic keys, OAuth tokens | [AID](https://agentids.org) |
| **TALK** | Communication | Agent-to-agent messaging | [AMP](https://agentmessaging.org) |
| **ACT** | Actions | Tool execution, API calls, workflows | [AAP](https://agentactions.org) |

**Open Protocols** — AI Maestro is built on three open standards:
- **[AMP](https://agentmessaging.org)** — Agent Messaging Protocol. Email-like communication between agents with cryptographic signatures.
- **[AID](https://agentids.org)** — Agent Identity. Portable cryptographic identity for agents across platforms.
- **[AAP](https://agentactions.org)** — Agent Actions Protocol. Standardized tool execution and workflow triggers.

AI Maestro is the stage. Pick personalities, give them skills, and run them from one dashboard.

## Who Is This For

**Founders building AI-first organizations.** You're the CEO, your agents are the team. Solo operators, agency owners, and anyone running a business where AI agents do the work and you drive the strategy. Start with Lola, add specialists, scale your AI workforce.

**Developers running multiple AI agents.** If you have 3+ agents and you're switching between terminals, losing context, and playing messenger — this is for you. Works with Claude Code, Codex, Aider, Cursor, or any terminal-based AI.

**Teams coordinating AI-assisted work.** Multiple developers, multiple agents, multiple machines. One dashboard. Agent-to-agent messaging replaces you as the bottleneck.

**Creators and operators** who want to connect AI agents to the outside world through Slack, Discord, or Email — without exposing their infrastructure.

## FAQ

**Do I need to use Claude Code?**
No. AI Maestro works with any terminal-based AI agent — Claude Code, Codex, Aider, Cursor, OpenClaw, Hermes, Droid, or your own scripts. We're agent-agnostic.

**Does it work on Linux / Windows?**
Yes. macOS and Linux natively. Windows via WSL2 — see the [Windows guide](./docs/WINDOWS-INSTALLATION.md).

**Can agents on different machines talk to each other?**
Yes. The [Agent Messaging Protocol (AMP)](https://agentmessaging.org) handles cross-machine messaging with cryptographic signatures and push notifications. No central server required.

**What are AID and AAP?**
[AID](https://agentids.org) (Agent Identity) gives each agent a portable cryptographic identity. [AAP](https://agentactions.org) (Agent Actions Protocol) standardizes how agents execute tools and trigger workflows. Together with [AMP](https://agentmessaging.org), they form the open protocol stack that AI Maestro is built on.

**What is the Canvas skill?**
Canvas lets agents generate visual artifacts — diagrams, charts, and interactive documents — directly from conversations. It's part of the plugin system and available to any agent.

**How is this different from just using tmux?**
tmux gives you terminals. AI Maestro gives you an organization — persistent memory, agent-to-agent messaging, team coordination, Kanban boards, multi-machine mesh, cloud deployment, and gateway integrations. tmux is the foundation; AI Maestro is the building.

**What is LolaBot?**
[LolaBot](https://github.com/23blocks-OS/lolabot) is an open-source agent framework — a batteries-included Chief of Staff that handles email, memory, tasks, and security. The [LolaBot Factory](https://lolabots.com) offers pre-built agent templates for one-click deployment.

**Is there a hosted / cloud version?**
Not yet. AI Maestro runs on your machines. You own your data, your agents, and your infrastructure.

**How do I add more agents?**
Create them from the dashboard UI, the CLI (`aimaestro-agent.sh create`), or just start a new tmux session — AI Maestro auto-discovers it.
