After downloading and installing many Skills, it is easy to sometimes forget which Skills have already been installed and not know which Skills to invoke. Further, when a complex task involves the combined organization and invocation of multiple Skills from different domains, planning becomes complicated for people: they must explain to the AI in detail which Skills each module should use, while the AI may forget these designs during execution. Many current harness frameworks do not actively plan how to make good use of local Skill resources, and may even fall into an either-or scheduling conflict between the harness framework and domain Skill resources. The core of this project is to follow harness frameworks similar to Superpower and GSD. Based on modular decomposition by the planning state machine, it uses different Skills to assist different modules, fully schedules existing local resources, reduces users' planning and cognitive burden, and gives users an end-to-end delivery experience. It is committed to becoming a handy steward for the Skill resources around you. When a complex task appears, it can help users slowly sort out which modules are needed and which good experiences can be reused, then deliver an excellent result.">

> **Task**
>
> *Use public data to complete a reproducible classification experiment and deliver a data audit, statistical review, 4 result figures, a scientific report, and a 7-slide group-meeting deck.*

The diagram shows what happened after the requirement and plan were approved:
how the task was executed, what it produced, and how the result was checked.

The task used the `L` workflow and proceeded in order. During publication
preparation, the configured folders on the same host contained more than 100
Skills. VibeSkills reviewed the candidates and their `SKILL.md` files, selected
7 for this task, and arranged the work into 5 groups and 10 work units. Those
units covered environment setup, data audit, modeling, statistical review,
figures, the report, and the slide deck.

After the work finished, VibeSkills ran 17 checks across the data, experiment
results, figures, report, and slides. The task passed final acceptance after the
required files, cross-deliverable consistency, and core reproduction all passed.

  </picture>
</h2>

*VibeSkills gives an Agent one process from receiving a task to checking the delivery.*

Each stage answers a concrete question: what needs to be done, how the
work should proceed, which Skills should take part, what actually happened, and
whether the result is ready to deliver.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/assets/vibeskills-harness-overview-en.svg" width="860" alt="VibeSkills confirms the requirement, chooses L or XL, organizes Skills, records the work, and checks the result; code work can enter a TDD loop">
</p>

<ol type="I">
  <li><strong>Confirms the requirement.</strong> Before work begins, it confirms the goal, constraints, available material, and expected delivery. The process stops here until the requirement is approved, giving the plan and final check a clear basis.</li>
  <li><strong>Recommends a level.</strong> VibeSkills recommends <code>L</code> or <code>XL</code> from the task's scope, steps, dependencies, and opportunities for parallel work. You then confirm the level. Manageable work proceeds in order; larger work is split more finely.</li>
  <li><strong>Organizes Skills.</strong> VibeSkills reviews the local Skill folders, selects the methods that fit each part, and states what each Skill owns, what it should deliver, and how completion will be checked.</li>
  <li><strong>Executes and records.</strong> After plan approval, the current Agent completes the work. Code tasks can use test-driven development (TDD) when appropriate: show the problem with a failing test, make the change, and run the tests again. Completed, failed, and blocked states are recorded so a later session can continue.</li>
  <li><strong>Checks the result.</strong> VibeSkills compares the actual result with every planned item. Required work that is incomplete, failed, or blocked prevents final acceptance.</li>
</ol>

<details>
<summary><strong>When to use L or XL</strong></summary>

| Level | Best for | How it works |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `L` | Multi-step work of manageable size | Splits the task, then works through the parts in order with less time and context overhead |
| `XL` | Larger work with several relatively independent parts | Uses a more detailed breakdown and can run up to two non-conflicting parts at the same time, with additional coordination and result collection |

*Local Skills can store tool usage, working steps, decision rules, and checking methods.*

VibeSkills reviews the local Skill folders you configure, then
shortlists the Skills that fit the work required by each part of the task.

</p>

The left side shows the different kinds of work in the task, VibeSkills makes
the assignment in the middle, and the local Skill folders are on the right. A
selected Skill is tied to concrete work, expected delivery, and a check. The
current Agent then follows the shared plan.

VibeSkills does something straightforward: **it first makes the whole task
clear, then assigns the right Skills to the relevant parts**. It coordinates
the work and checks the combined result at the end. The task uses the Skills it
needs; the rest of the local library stays available without entering the plan.

You can keep adding your own Skills, team Skills, and third-party Skills.
VibeSkills does not call every installed Skill automatically; it selects the
Skills that fit the current task. The size of the library defines the available
choices, not a list that every task must use.

<details>
<summary><strong>Will a large Skill library use a lot of tokens?</strong></summary>

VibeSkills checks the Skill folders you configure, but finding files locally
and placing their full contents in the model context are different operations.

Discovery and index generation happen locally. VibeSkills first extracts compact
information such as each Skill's name, description, intended use, and boundaries,
then uses that information to shortlist candidates for each part of the task.

Only retained candidates are then read as complete `SKILL.md` files. Execution
uses only the Skills written into the plan. Token usage therefore depends mainly
on how many candidates the task retains, how long those documents are, and how
complex the task is. It is not the same as reading the full local Skill library
into the model context.

This overhead is not zero. More candidates, longer Skill documents, or a more
finely divided task will use more context. The current design bounds that cost
with a local index, candidate shortlisting, and on-demand reading.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Local folders and selection records</strong></summary>

Alongside the shared Skills directory, more local folders can be listed in
`~/.vibeskills/skill-roots.json` or
`<workspace>/.vibeskills/skill-roots.json`.

A Skill needs a readable `SKILL.md`, a name that does not conflict with another
Skill, and a clear fit for the current work before it can be selected. Adding a
local folder makes those Skills available to later tasks without waiting for the
VibeSkills repository to include them.

During planning, `agent_skill_organization` stores which Skills are intended for
each part of the task. During execution, `module_assignments` stores the actual
assignment. Finding a Skill means it can be considered; it does not mean the
Skill has already taken part in the work.

*A public example lets readers follow the requirement, plan, actual result, and final check.*

VibeSkills keeps the approved requirement, plan, execution progress, and final
check in the same task record. A later session can continue from the saved
progress, and a review can compare the original plan with the actual result.
Installation state is recorded separately so it is not confused with task
completion.

<details>
<summary><strong>View the record files</strong></summary>

| File or directory | What it is for |
|:---|:---|
| `install-receipt.json` | Records the files written by the installer so `check` can find missing or changed files |
| `session_root` | Stores the input, progress, important decisions, and summary for one task |
| `module-work-plan.json` | Stores the approved work plan, including responsibility, expected output, and checks |
| `module-execution.json` | Stores what each part actually produced and whether it completed, failed, or was blocked |
| `delivery-acceptance-report.json` or `.md` | Stores the final check and shows which items passed |

Maintainers can use the
[pre-release checks](https://github.com/foryourhealth111-pixel/Vibe-Skills/actions/workflows/vco-gates.yml). Start with
the checks in that list and run wider audits only when there is a reason.

</details>

A successful installation does not mean the task ran, and a task record does
not mean the final result passed its checks.
