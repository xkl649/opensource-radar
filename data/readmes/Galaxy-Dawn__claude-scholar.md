## Recent News

- **2026-06-03**: **Kimi Code CLI branch added with strong support from Kimi** — added the `kimi` branch as the Kimi Code CLI edition of Claude Scholar and thank the Kimi team for their strong support of this project.
- **2026-05-14**: **`expression-skill` made the communication core, `planning-with-files` restored as the default persistence layer, and the Nature writing stack expanded** — made [`expression-skill`](./skills/expression-skill/README.md) the explicit conclusion-first discipline for reporting, planning, file operations, and multi-step technical work; reintroduced [`planning-with-files`](./skills/planning-with-files/SKILL.md) as the default on-disk planning and progress-tracking workflow for complex tasks; introduced [`nature-writing`](./skills/nature-writing/README.md) for section drafting and argument construction; refreshed [`nature-polishing`](./skills/nature-polishing/README.md) to the latest upstream article-pattern release; and kept [`nature-response`](./skills/nature-response/README.md) plus [`nature-data`](./skills/nature-data/README.md) in the journal-writing stack.
- **2026-05-13**: **Evidence-gated research workflow and `Sources/Papers` routing tightened** — added a shared `research-contract.md` for Evidence Records, claim strength, and Claim Promotion Gates; connected research ideation, Zotero ingestion, literature synthesis, results reporting, writing, and rebuttal workflows to that contract; and clarified that project paper notes live under `Sources/Papers` before promoted claims move into `Knowledge` or `Writing`.
- **2026-04-24**: **Project-scoped Obsidian KB workflow consolidated** — rebuilt Obsidian project knowledge management into a vault-first workflow, consolidated the older overlapping memory skills into four focused skills, kept repo-local project binding metadata as a runtime layer, and made project navigation human-first instead of a machine registry dump.
- **2026-04-22**: **Lean core, pruned default agents, safer install lifecycle, and cleaner paper discovery** — replaced large always-on `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` files with compact core instructions, pruned the default agent set to the retained core agents, added safe install-state based uninstall support, generalized `daily-paper-generator` to broader topics with arXiv / bioRxiv support and a fixed Top 10 -> Top 3 -> Top 1 selection flow.
- **2026-04-15**: **pubfig and pubtab introduced** — introduced [`pubfig`](https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/pubfig), a Python package for publication-grade scientific figures, and [`pubtab`](https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/pubtab), a Python package for publication-ready tables and Excel↔LaTeX workflows. Together they provide a cleaner production stack for paper figures, benchmark tables, export control, and final artifact QA.

<summary>View older changelog</summary>

- **2026-04-15**: **[`publication-chart-skill`](./skills/publication-chart-skill/SKILL.md) integrated into Claude Scholar** — wrapped [`pubfig`](https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/pubfig) + [`pubtab`](https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/pubtab) into [`publication-chart-skill`](./skills/publication-chart-skill/SKILL.md), added the skill to the repository, and connected it to Claude Scholar's analysis and writing boundaries so publication-grade figure/table work now has an explicit handoff route instead of being mixed into general analysis or prose skills.
- **2026-03-31**: **Zotero smart-import workflow docs aligned** — updated Claude Scholar's research-facing docs around the latest `zotero-mcp` public surface: `zotero_add_items_by_identifier` is now the default paper-import path, `zotero_reconcile_collection_duplicates` is the standard post-import cleanup step, source-aware PDF cascade behavior is documented more accurately, and public vs internal diagnostics are now clearly separated.
- **2026-03-31**: **README onboarding refreshed** — clarified that Claude Scholar is especially well-suited to computer science and AI researchers, added practical getting-started scenarios after installation, improved prerequisite and branch guidance, and made the “existing local md files must be manually merged” expectation much more explicit.
- **2026-03-31**: **Installer and hook behavior tightened** — the installer now preserves existing local `CLAUDE.md` while installing the repo-managed version as `CLAUDE.scholar.md`, and the default hook summaries were trimmed to reduce noisy temp-file / uncommitted-file output while keeping safer write-guard behavior.
- **2026-03-31**: **Japanese documentation added** — added Japanese docs for the main README plus `AGENTS`, `MCP_SETUP`, and `OBSIDIAN_SETUP`, so the OpenCode branch now has a more complete multilingual documentation surface.

- **2026-02-25**: **Codex CLI** support — added `codex` branch supporting [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) with config.toml, 40 skills, 14 agents, and sandbox security

## Why Claude Scholar

Claude Scholar is **not** an end-to-end autonomous research system that tries to replace the researcher.

Its core idea is simple:

> **human decision-making stays at the center; the assistant accelerates the workflow around it.**

That means Claude Scholar is designed to help with the heavy, repetitive, and structure-sensitive parts of research — literature organization, note-taking, experiment analysis, reporting, and writing support — while still keeping the key judgments in human hands:

- which problem is worth pursuing,
- which papers actually matter,
- which hypotheses are worth testing,
- which results are convincing,
- and what should be written, submitted, or abandoned.

In other words, Claude Scholar is a **semi-automated research assistant**, not a “fully automated scientist.”

## Who This Is For

Claude Scholar is especially well-suited to:

- **computer science researchers** who move between literature review, coding, experiments, and paper writing,
- **AI / ML researchers** who need one assistant workflow spanning ideation, implementation, analysis, reporting, and rebuttal,
- **research engineers and graduate students** who want stronger workflow structure without giving up human judgment,
- and **software-heavy academic projects** that benefit from Zotero, Obsidian, CLI automation, and reproducible project memory.

It can still help in other research settings, but its current workflow design is most aligned with computer science, AI, and adjacent computational research.

## Core Workflow

Claude Scholar routes research work through a traceable path:
`question -> evidence -> experiment -> analysis -> claim -> writing`.
Each stage should preserve what is known, what is uncertain, and what decision should happen next.

- **Ideation**: turn a vague topic into concrete questions, research gaps, and an initial plan.
- **Literature**: search, import, organize, and read papers through Zotero collections.
- **Paper notes**: convert papers into structured reading notes and reusable claims.
- **Knowledge base**: route durable knowledge into Obsidian across `Sources / Knowledge / Experiments / Results / Results/Reports / Writing / Daily / Maps`.
- **Experiments**: track hypotheses, experiment lines, run history, findings, and next actions.
- **Analysis**: generate strict statistics, real scientific figures, and analysis artifacts with `results-analysis`.
- **Reporting**: produce a complete post-experiment report with `results-report`, then write it back into Obsidian.
- **Writing and publication**: carry stable findings into literature reviews, papers, rebuttals, slides, posters, and promotion.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)
- Git
- (Optional) Python + [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python development
- (Optional) [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) + [Galaxy-Dawn/zotero-mcp](https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/zotero-mcp) for literature workflows
- (Optional) [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for project knowledge-base workflows

### Option 1: Full Installation (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/claude-scholar.git /tmp/claude-scholar
bash /tmp/claude-scholar/scripts/setup.sh
```

**Windows**: please use Git Bash or WSL to run the installer.

The installer is **backup-aware and incremental-update friendly**:
- updates repo-managed `skills/commands/agents/rules/hooks/scripts/CLAUDE*.md`,
- backs up overwritten files to `~/.claude/.claude-scholar-backups/<timestamp>/`,
- backs up `settings.json` to `settings.json.bak`,
- preserves an existing `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and installs the repo-managed version as `~/.claude/CLAUDE.scholar.md`,
- preserves an existing `~/.claude/CLAUDE.zh-CN.md` and installs the repo-managed version as `~/.claude/CLAUDE.zh-CN.scholar.md`,
- preserves your existing `env`, model/provider settings, API keys, permissions, and current `mcpServers` values,
- adds missing hook entries instead of replacing your entire hook set.

**Important CLAUDE note**: if you already maintain your own `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `~/.claude/CLAUDE.zh-CN.md`, review `~/.claude/CLAUDE.scholar.md` and `~/.claude/CLAUDE.zh-CN.scholar.md` after installation and manually merge the Claude Scholar sections you want into your own files. Do not assume the sidecar files are applied automatically.

To update later:

```bash
cd /tmp/claude-scholar
git pull --ff-only
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

To uninstall later:

```bash
cd /tmp/claude-scholar
bash scripts/uninstall.sh
```

The installer now writes:
- `~/.claude/.claude-scholar-manifest.txt` for the exact files managed by Claude Scholar
- `~/.claude/.claude-scholar-install-state` for install ownership metadata used by safe uninstall

The uninstaller removes only files and settings entries recorded in that install state. It does not guess ownership from the current repo checkout.

### Option 2: Minimal Installation

Install only a small research-focused subset:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/claude-scholar.git /tmp/claude-scholar
mkdir -p ~/.claude/hooks ~/.claude/skills
cp /tmp/claude-scholar/hooks/*.js ~/.claude/hooks/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/ml-paper-writing ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/research-ideation ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/results-analysis ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/results-report ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/review-response ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/writing-anti-ai ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/git-workflow ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/bug-detective ~/.claude/skills/
```

**Post-install**: minimal/manual install does **not** auto-merge `settings.json`; copy only the hooks or MCP entries you want from `settings.json.template`. If you already have your own `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `~/.claude/CLAUDE.zh-CN.md`, also merge the relevant sections from this repo's Claude files into yours instead of blindly overwriting them.

### Option 3: Selective Installation

Copy only the parts you need:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/claude-scholar.git /tmp/claude-scholar
cd /tmp/claude-scholar

cp hooks/*.js ~/.claude/hooks/
cp -r skills/latex-conference-template-organizer ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r skills/architecture-design ~/.claude/skills/
cp agents/paper-miner.md ~/.claude/agents/
cp rules/coding-style.md ~/.claude/rules/
cp rules/agents.md ~/.claude/rules/
```

**Post-install**: selective/manual install does **not** auto-merge `settings.json`; copy only the hooks or MCP entries you actually want from `settings.json.template`. If you already have your own `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `~/.claude/CLAUDE.zh-CN.md`, merge the relevant sections from this repo's Claude files into yours instead of blindly overwriting them.

### Option 4: Plugin Marketplace Installation

**Step 1: Install the Plugin**

```bash
/plugin marketplace add Galaxy-Dawn/claude-scholar
/plugin install claude-scholar@claude-scholar
```

This auto-loads all skills, commands, agents, and hooks. During installation, you can choose the scope: user (all projects) or project (single project).

**Step 2: Install Rules (Required)**

Claude Code plugins cannot distribute rules automatically. Install them manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/claude-scholar.git /tmp/claude-scholar

# User-level (all projects)
mkdir -p ~/.claude/rules
cp /tmp/claude-scholar/rules/*.md ~/.claude/rules/

# Or project-level (current project only)
mkdir -p .claude/rules
cp /tmp/claude-scholar/rules/*.md .claude/rules/
```

**Post-install**: plugin installation does **not** auto-load `CLAUDE.md` or configure `settings.json`; if you already have your own `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `~/.claude/CLAUDE.zh-CN.md`, merge the relevant Claude Scholar sections into yours instead of assuming the plugin applies them automatically. If you need Zotero MCP or other integrations, see the [Integrations](#integrations) section for manual setup.

## Getting Started Scenarios

After installation, the simplest way to begin is to describe your task in natural language. You do not need to memorize the whole system first. Below are a few realistic starting points.

### 1. Start a New Research Topic
**You can say:**
> Help me start research on [your topic]. I want a literature-grounded plan, the key open questions, and the next concrete steps.

**What Claude Scholar will typically help with:**
- clarify the topic and narrow the research question,
- identify promising literature directions,
- suggest an initial plan or hypothesis list,
- optionally route the work into Zotero or Obsidian if you use them.

### 2. Review a Zotero Collection
**You can say:**
> Review my Zotero collection on brain foundation models and summarize the main directions, gaps, and promising next steps.

**Typical output:**
- paper grouping by theme,
- a short literature synthesis,
- gap analysis,
- candidate research directions worth pursuing next.

### 3. Analyze Finished Experiment Results
**You can say:**
> Analyze the results in this experiment folder, check what changed across runs, and write a decision-oriented summary.

**Typical output:**
- metric comparison,
- ablation or error-analysis suggestions,
- a result summary that highlights what is solid, what is weak, and what to run next.

### 4. Draft a Paper or Rebuttal Section
**You can say:**
> Help me draft the related work section for this project based on the current findings and paper notes.

or:

> Help me write a rebuttal draft for these reviewer comments.

**Typical output:**
- a structured section draft,
- improved argument flow,
- clearer claims and evidence mapping,
- follow-up points that still need support or verification.

### Practical Notes
- Start with one concrete task, not a vague request for "everything."
- If you already maintain your own local `CLAUDE.md` files, merge the Claude Scholar sections you want into them instead of assuming sidecar files apply automatically.
- Zotero and Obsidian are optional, but they become much more useful when you want durable literature notes or project memory rather than one-off chat output.

## Platform Support

Claude Scholar is maintained for:

- **Claude Code** — the primary installation target.
- **Codex CLI** — supported workflow and documentation are available in this repo ecosystem.
- **OpenCode** — supported as an alternative CLI workflow.

The top-level workflow is the same: research, coding, experiments, reporting, and project knowledge management.

## Integrations

### Zotero

Use Zotero when you want Claude Scholar to help with:
- paper import via DOI / arXiv / URL,
- collection-based reading workflows,
- full-text access through Zotero MCP,
- detailed paper notes and literature synthesis.

See [MCP_SETUP.md](./MCP_SETUP.md).

### Obsidian

Use Obsidian when you want Claude Scholar to maintain a filesystem-first research knowledge base:
- `Sources/`
- `Knowledge/`
- `Experiments/`
- `Results/`
- `Results/Reports/`
- `Writing/`
- `Daily/`
- `Maps/`

See [OBSIDIAN_SETUP.md](./OBSIDIAN_SETUP.md).

## Primary Workflows

Complete academic research lifecycle — 7 stages from idea to publication.

### 1. Research Ideation (Zotero-Integrated)

End-to-end research startup from idea generation to literature management.

| Type | Name | One-line explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Skill | `research-ideation` | Turn vague topics into structured questions, gap analysis, and an initial research plan. |
| Agent | `literature-reviewer` | Search, classify, and synthesize papers into an actionable literature picture. |
| Command | `/research-init` | Start a new topic with literature search, Zotero organization, research question cards, and proposal drafting only when the evidence gate passes. |
| Command | `/zotero-review` | Review an existing Zotero collection and generate a structured literature synthesis. |
| Command | `/zotero-notes` | Batch-read a Zotero collection and create structured paper reading notes. |

**How it works**
- **5W1H Brainstorming**: turn a vague topic into structured questions (`What / Why / Who / When / Where / How`).
- **Literature Search & Import**: search papers, extract DOI/arXiv/URLs, import them into Zotero, and organize them into themed collections.
- **PDF & Full Text**: attach PDFs when available, read full text when possible, and fall back to abstract-level analysis when necessary.
- **Gap Analysis**: identify literature, methodological, application, interdisciplinary, or temporal gaps.
- **Research Question & Planning**: convert the review into concrete questions, initial hypotheses, and next-step planning.
- **Evidence Gate**: keep weak sources, project hypotheses, and missing evidence explicit before promoting a claim into `Knowledge`, `Writing`, or a proposal.

**Typical output**
- research question cards with hypotheses, evidence needs, falsification criteria, and next actions
- literature review notes
- structured Zotero collection
- project proposal only when the selected question has enough verified evidence; otherwise a research direction / intake draft

### 2. ML Project Development

Maintainable ML project structure for experiment code and iteration.

| Type | Name | One-line explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Skill | `architecture-design` | Define maintainable ML project structure when new registrable components or modules are introduced. |
| Skill | `git-workflow` | Enforce branch hygiene, commit conventions, and safer collaboration workflows. |
| Skill | `bug-detective` | Debug stack traces, shell failures, and code-path issues systematically. |
| Agent | `code-reviewer` | Review modified code for correctness, maintainability, and implementation quality. |
| Agent | `tdd-guide` | Provide focused test-driven implementation guidance when a TDD path is explicitly needed. |
| Command | `/plan` | Create or refine an implementation plan before coding. |
| Command | `/commit` | Prepare a conventional commit for the current changes. |
| Command | `/code-review` | Run a focused review on the current code changes. |
| Command | `/tdd` | Drive feature work through small, test-backed implementation steps. |

**How it works**
- **Structure**: use Factory / Registry patterns for new ML components when appropriate.
- **Code Quality**: keep files maintainable, typed, and config-driven.
- **Debugging**: inspect stack traces, shell failures, and code-path issues systematically.
- **Git Discipline**: use branch hygiene, conventional commits, and safer merge/rebase workflows.

### 3. Experiment Analysis

Strict analysis of experimental results with scientific figures and report-ready artifacts.

| Type | Name | One-line explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Skill | `results-analysis` | Produce a strict analysis bundle with rigorous statistics, real scientific figures, and analysis artifacts. |
| Skill | `results-report` | Turn analysis artifacts into a complete post-experiment report with decisions, limitations, and next actions. |
| Command | `/analyze-results` | Run a blocker-first experiment workflow: validate evidence, run strict analysis when possible, then generate a report only when the bundle is sufficient. |

**How it works**
- **Data Processing**: read experiment logs, metrics files, and result directories.
- **Blocker-First Gate**: lock unit of analysis, primary metric, seeds/folds/runs, provenance, and comparison family before producing claims.
- **Statistical Testing**: run strict statistical checks such as t-test / ANOVA / Wilcoxon where appropriate.
- **Visualization**: generate real scientific figures with interpretation guidance, not just vague plotting suggestions.
- **Ablation & Comparison**: analyze component contribution, performance tradeoffs, and stability.
- **Post-Experiment Reporting**: turn the analysis bundle into a full retrospective report with conclusions, limitations, and next actions.

**Typical output**
- `analysis-report.md`
- `stats-appendix.md`
- `figure-catalog.md`
- `figures/`
- post-experiment summary report in Obsidian `Results/Reports/`
- blocker summary / audit note when evidence is incomplete

### 4. Paper Writing

Systematic academic writing from structure setup to draft refinement.

| Type | Name | One-line explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Skill | `ml-paper-writing` | Draft publication-oriented ML/AI papers from repo context, evidence, and literature. |
| Skill | [`nature-writing`](./skills/nature-writing/README.md) | Draft or rebuild Nature-style manuscript sections from claims, figures, results, notes, or Chinese drafts. |
| Skill | [`nature-polishing`](./skills/nature-polishing/README.md) | Polish, restructure, or translate manuscript prose into concise Nature-leaning English. |
| Skill | [`nature-response`](./skills/nature-response/README.md) | Draft, audit, or revise point-by-point reviewer response letters for Nature-family revisions. |
| Skill | [`nature-data`](./skills/nature-data/README.md) | Prepare Nature-ready Data Availability statements, repository plans, and FAIR metadata checks. |
| Skill | `citation-verification` | Check references, metadata, and claim-citation alignment to prevent citation mistakes. |
| Skill | `writing-anti-ai` | Reduce robotic phrasing and improve clarity, rhythm, and human academic tone. |
| Skill | `latex-conference-template-organizer` | Clean messy conference templates into an Overleaf-ready writing structure. |
| Agent | `paper-miner` | Mine strong papers for reusable writing patterns, structure, and venue expectations. |
| Command | `/mine-writing-patterns` | Read a paper and merge reusable writing knowledge into the active installed paper-miner writing memory. |

**How it works**
- **Template Preparation**: clean conference templates into an Overleaf-ready structure.
- **Journal-Style Polishing**: tighten paragraph logic, hedging, and section moves for Nature-leaning prose when needed.
- **Reviewer Response**: structure major/minor revision comments into an auditable point-by-point response package.
- **Data Availability**: prepare Nature-ready repository plans, dataset citations, and availability statements.
- **Citation Verification**: verify references, metadata, and claim-citation alignment.
- **Systematic Writing**: draft sections from repo context, experiment evidence, and literature notes, while keeping unsupported claims marked instead of polished.
- **Claim Ledger**: every contribution, result, and contrast should trace to evidence or remain explicitly speculative.
- **Style Refinement**: reduce robotic phrasing and improve rhythm, clarity, and tone.

### 5. Paper Self-Review

Quality assurance before submission.

| Type | Name | One-line explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Skill | `paper-self-review` | Audit structure, logic, citations, figures, and compliance before submission. |

**How it works**
- **Structure Check**: logical flow, section balance, and narrative coherence.
- **Logic Validation**: claim-evidence alignment, assumption clarity, and argument consistency.
- **Claim Audit**: verify that main claims are supported by evidence, weaken over-strong language, and preserve uncertainty when needed.
- **Citation Audit**: reference correctness and completeness.
- **Figure Quality**: caption completeness, readability, and accessibility.
- **Compliance**: page limits, formatting, and disclosure requirements.

### 6. Submission & Rebuttal

Submission preparation and review response workflow.

| Type | Name | One-line explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Skill | `review-response` | Structure reviewer comments into an evidence-based rebuttal workflow. |
| Agent | `rebuttal-writer` | Optional specialist for professional, respectful, and strategically organized rebuttal text when available. |
| Command | `/rebuttal` | Generate an evidence-anchored rebuttal draft from review comments, with unresolved points marked instead of hidden. |

**How it works**
- **Pre-submission Checks**: venue-specific formatting, anonymization, and checklist requirements.
- **Review Analysis**: classify reviewer comments into actionable categories.
- **Response Strategy**: decide whether to accept, defend, clarify, or propose new experiments.
- **Rebuttal Writing**: generate structured responses with professional tone, evidence anchors, and explicit unresolved items.

### 7. Post-Acceptance Processing

Conference preparation and research promotion after acceptance.

| Type | Name | One-line explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Skill | `post-acceptance` | Support talks, posters, and research promotion after acceptance. |
| Command | `/presentation` | Generate presentation structure and speaking guidance for the accepted work. |
| Command | `/poster` | Organize the work into poster-ready content and layout guidance. |
| Command | `/promote` | Draft public-facing promotion content such as summaries, posts, or threads. |

**How it works**
- **Presentation**: prepare talk structure and slide guidance.
- **Poster**: organize content into poster-ready layout and hierarchy.
- **Promotion**: generate social media, blog, or summary material for broader communication.

## Supporting Workflows

These workflows run in the background to strengthen the primary workflows.

### Obsidian Project Knowledge Base

Use Obsidian as the project-scoped durable knowledge surface, not just as a note dump.

| Type | Name | One-line explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Skill | `obsidian-project-kb-core` | Main authority for project-scoped KB bootstrap, routing, registry, index, daily, and lifecycle updates. |
| Skill | `obsidian-source-ingestion` | Ingest external material into `Sources/Papers`, `Sources/Web`, `Sources/Docs`, `Sources/Data`, `Sources/Interviews`, or `Sources/Notes`. |
| Skill | `obsidian-literature-workflow` | Run the paper-note to synthesis workflow from `Sources/Papers` into `Knowledge`, `Writing`, and `Maps/literature.canvas`. |
| Skill | `obsidian-kb-artifacts` | Handle Obsidian-native artifacts such as wikilinks, registry tables, canvas files, optional Bases, and link repair. |
| Command | `/kb-init` | Initialize the vault-first KB under `Research/{project-slug}/`. |
| Command | `/kb-status` | Summarize the current KB state from the bound project root. |
| Command | `/kb-ingest` | Route new source material into the correct canonical KB destination. |
| Command | `/kb-log` | Update the current Daily note and related project surfaces conservatively. |
| Command | `/kb-sync` | Run deterministic KB maintenance to refresh registry, index, daily, and runtime binding state. |
| Command | `/kb-links` | Repair or strengthen wikilinks among canonical KB notes. |
| Command | `/kb-promote` | Promote durable content from Daily or source notes into canonical notes. |
| Command | `/kb-index` | Regenerate `02-Index.md` as the human-readable project navigator. |
| Command | `/kb-lint` | Run deterministic KB health checks and update `_system/lint-report.md`. |
| Command | `/kb-archive` | Archive, detach, purge, or rename KB objects while keeping links and registry consistent. |
| Command | `/kb-map` | Generate or repair explicit-only KB artifacts beyond the default literature canvas. |
| Command | `/kb-literature-review` | Generate evidence-gated literature synthesis from `Sources/Papers` into `Knowledge`, optional `Writing`, and `Maps/literature.canvas`. |

**How it works**
- bind an existing repo to an Obsidian vault,
- route stable knowledge into `Sources / Knowledge / Experiments / Results / Results/Reports / Writing / Daily / Maps`,
- keep `Daily/` and repo-local binding metadata updated conservatively,
- ingest new source material into the correct canonical destination,
- keep abstract-only and webpage-placeholder sources from supporting durable claims,
- only generate extra Bases or canvases on explicit request.
- use `/kb-sync` for deterministic resyncs and `/kb-links` for standalone link repair.

**Note language configuration**

Generated and synced Obsidian notes resolve their language with this priority:
1. project config: `.claude/project-memory/registry.yaml` -> `note_language`
2. environment variable: `OBSIDIAN_NOTE_LANGUAGE`
3. default: `en`

Note: the file is currently named `registry.yaml` for historical reasons, but its on-disk format is JSON.

Per-project example:

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "my-project": {
      "project_id": "my-project",
      "vault_root": "/path/to/vault/Research/my-project",
      "note_language": "zh-CN"
    }
  }
}
```

English and Chinese section headings remain mutually compatible during sync, so older notes in either language can still be updated safely after switching configuration.

### Automated Enforcement Workflow

Cross-platform hooks automate routine workflow checks and reminders.

**Hooks**
- `skill-forced-eval.js`
- `session-start.js`
- `session-summary.js`
- `stop-summary.js`
- `security-guard.js`

**How it works**
- **Before prompts**: evaluate applicable skills and surface relevant workflow hints.
- **At session start**: show Git state, available commands, and project-memory context.
- **At session end/stop**: summarize work and remind the user about minimum maintenance tasks.
- **Security**: block catastrophic commands and require confirmation for dangerous but legitimate ones.

### Communication and Reporting Discipline

Use a reusable communication layer when the task needs conclusion-first reporting, concrete evidence, visible risk, or compact next-step guidance.

| Type | Name | One-line explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Skill | [`expression-skill`](./skills/expression-skill/README.md) | Enforces conclusion-first, concrete, checkable communication for technical work, writing, documentation, file operations, and multi-step tasks. |
| Skill | [`planning-with-files`](./skills/planning-with-files/SKILL.md) | Makes complex work persistent on disk with `task_plan.md`, `notes.md`, and deliverable files instead of relying only on transient chat context. |

**How it works**
- lead with the conclusion instead of narration,
- prefer commands, paths, counts, checks, and observable behavior over abstract process language,
- ask clarifying questions only when ambiguity changes the outcome,
- surface risk, uncertainty, and destructive boundaries early,
- keep long-running work visible with step / checkpoint style roadmarks,
- persist multi-step work to disk with `task_plan.md` and `notes.md` instead of relying only on transient context.

### Knowledge Extraction Workflow

Specialized agents can mine reusable knowledge from papers and competitions.

| Type | Name | One-line explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Agent | `paper-miner` | Extract reusable writing knowledge, structure patterns, and venue heuristics from strong papers. |
| Agent | `kaggle-miner` | Extract engineering practices and solution patterns from strong Kaggle workflows. |

**How it works**
- extract writing patterns, venue expectations, and rebuttal strategies from papers,
- extract engineering patterns and solution structure from Kaggle workflows,
- feed those insights back into skills and reference material.

### Skill Evolution System

Claude Scholar also contains a self-improvement loop for its own skills.

| Type | Name | One-line explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Skill | `skill-development` | Create new skills with clear triggers, structure, and progressive disclosure. |
| Skill | `skill-quality-reviewer` | Review skills across content quality, organization, style, and structural integrity. |
| Skill | `skill-improver` | Apply structured improvement plans to evolve existing skills. |

**How it works**
- create new skills with clear trigger descriptions,
- review them across quality dimensions,
- apply structured improvements and iterate.
