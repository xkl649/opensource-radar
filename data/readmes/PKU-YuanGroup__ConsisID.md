## 🤗 Demo
### Diffusers API

```bash
!pip install diffusers==0.33.1
import torch
from diffusers import ConsisIDPipeline
from diffusers.pipelines.consisid.consisid_utils import prepare_face_models, process_face_embeddings_infer
from diffusers.utils import export_to_video
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download

snapshot_download(repo_id="BestWishYsh/ConsisID-preview", local_dir="BestWishYsh/ConsisID-preview")
face_helper_1, face_helper_2, face_clip_model, face_main_model, eva_transform_mean, eva_transform_std = (
    prepare_face_models("BestWishYsh/ConsisID-preview", device="cuda", dtype=torch.bfloat16)
)
pipe = ConsisIDPipeline.from_pretrained("BestWishYsh/ConsisID-preview", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
pipe.to("cuda")

# ConsisID works well with long and well-described prompts. Make sure the face in the image is clearly visible (e.g., preferably half-body or full-body).
prompt = "The video captures a boy walking along a city street, filmed in black and white on a classic 35mm camera. His expression is thoughtful, his brow slightly furrowed as if he's lost in contemplation. The film grain adds a textured, timeless quality to the image, evoking a sense of nostalgia. Around him, the cityscape is filled with vintage buildings, cobblestone sidewalks, and softly blurred figures passing by, their outlines faint and indistinct. Streetlights cast a gentle glow, while shadows play across the boy's path, adding depth to the scene. The lighting highlights the boy's subtle smile, hinting at a fleeting moment of curiosity. The overall cinematic atmosphere, complete with classic film still aesthetics and dramatic contrasts, gives the scene an evocative and introspective feel."
image = "https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/consisid/consisid_input.png?download=true"

id_cond, id_vit_hidden, image, face_kps = process_face_embeddings_infer(
    face_helper_1,
    face_clip_model,
    face_helper_2,
    eva_transform_mean,
    eva_transform_std,
    face_main_model,
    "cuda",
    torch.bfloat16,
    image,
    is_align_face=True,
)

video = pipe(
    image=image,

    num_inference_steps=50,

    generator=torch.Generator("cuda").manual_seed(42),
)
export_to_video(video.frames[0], "output.mp4", fps=8)
```

### Gradio Web UI

Highly recommend trying out our web demo by the following command, which incorporates all features currently supported by ConsisID. We also provide [online demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/BestWishYsh/ConsisID-preview-Space) in Hugging Face Spaces.

```bash
python app.py
```

### CLI Inference

```bash
python infer.py --model_path BestWishYsh/ConsisID-preview
```

warning: It is worth noting that even if we use the same seed and prompt but we change a machine, the results will be different.

### Prompt Refiner

ConsisID has high requirements for prompt quality. You can use [GPT-4o](https://chatgpt.com/) to refine the input text prompt, an example is as follows (original prompt: "a man is playing guitar.")
```bash
a man is playing guitar.

Change the sentence above to something like this (add some facial changes, even if they are minor. Don't make the sentence too long): 

The video features a man standing next to an airplane, engaged in a conversation on his cell phone. he is wearing sunglasses and a black top, and he appears to be talking seriously. The airplane has a green stripe running along its side, and there is a large engine visible behind his. The man seems to be standing near the entrance of the airplane, possibly preparing to board or just having disembarked. The setting suggests that he might be at an airport or a private airfield. The overall atmosphere of the video is professional and focused, with the man's attire and the presence of the airplane indicating a business or travel context.
```

Some sample prompts are available [here](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/ConsisID/blob/main/asserts/prompt.xlsx).

### GPU Memory Optimization

ConsisID requires about 44 GB of GPU memory to decode 49 frames (6 seconds of video at 8 FPS) with output resolution 720x480 (W x H), which makes it not possible to run on consumer GPUs or free-tier T4 Colab. The following memory optimizations could be used to reduce the memory footprint. For replication, you can refer to [this](https://gist.github.com/SHYuanBest/bc4207c36f454f9e969adbb50eaf8258) script.

| Feature (overlay the previous) | Max Memory Allocated | Max Memory Reserved |
| :----------------------------- | :------------------- | :------------------ |
| -                              | 37 GB                | 44 GB               |
| enable_model_cpu_offload       | 22 GB                | 25 GB               |
| enable_sequential_cpu_offload  | 16 GB                | 22 GB               |
| vae.enable_slicing             | 16 GB                | 22 GB               |
| vae.enable_tiling              | 5 GB                 | 7 GB                |

```bash
# turn on if you don't have multiple GPUs or enough GPU memory(such as H100)
pipe.enable_model_cpu_offload()
pipe.enable_sequential_cpu_offload()
pipe.vae.enable_slicing()
pipe.vae.enable_tiling()
```
warning: it will cost more time in inference and may also reduce the quality.

## 🚀 Parallel Inference on Multiple GPUs by xDiT

[xDiT](https://github.com/xdit-project/xDiT) is a Scalable Inference Engine for Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) on multi-GPU Clusters. It has successfully provided low-latency parallel inference solutions for a variety of DiTs models. For example, to generate a video with 6 GPUs, you can use the following command:

```
cd tools/parallel_inference
bash run.sh
# run_usp.sh
```

## 🚀 Cache Inference by TeaCache

[TeaCache](https://github.com/LiewFeng/TeaCache) is a training-free caching approach that estimates and leverages the fluctuating differences among model outputs across timesteps, thereby accelerating the inference.  For example, you can use the following command:

```
cd tools/cache_inference
bash run.sh
```

## ⚙️ Requirements and Installation

## 🗝️ Training

### Data preprocessing

Please refer to [this guide](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/ConsisID/tree/main/data_preprocess) for how to obtain the [training data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BestWishYsh/ConsisID-preview-Data) required by ConsisID. If you want to train your own identity-preserving text-to-video generation model, you need to arrange all the dataset in this [format](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/ConsisID/tree/main/asserts/demo_train_data/dataname):

```
📦 datasets/

### Video DiT training

First, setting hyperparameters:

- environment (e.g., cuda): [deepspeed_configs](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/ConsisID/tree/main/util/deepspeed_configs)
- training arguments (e.g., batchsize): [train_single_rank.sh](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/ConsisID/blob/main/train_single_rank.sh) or [train_multi_rank.sh](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/ConsisID/blob/main/train_multi_rank.sh)

Then, we run the following bash to start training:

```bash
# For single rank
bash train_single_rank.sh
# For multi rank
bash train_multi_rank.sh
```
