## Why Vibe Workflow Over Weavy AI / Krea Nodes / Freepik Spaces / FloraFauna AI?

| Feature | Vibe Workflow | Weavy AI | Krea Nodes | Freepik Spaces | FloraFauna AI |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Open Source | ✅ MIT | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Self-Hostable | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Node-Based Editor | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Partial | ✅ |
| Custom AI Models | ✅ | Limited | Limited | ❌ | Limited |
| No Subscription | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Extendable / API | ✅ | Limited | Limited | ❌ | Limited |

Paid AI creative tools have become [ridiculously expensive](https://medium.com/@anilmatcha/i-built-open-weavy-because-paid-ai-creative-tools-were-getting-ridiculously-expensive-f67b088e06fb). Vibe Workflow bridges the gap between complex generative AI capabilities and intuitive visual design. Where tools like Weavy AI and Krea Nodes offer powerful node-based systems behind paywalls, Vibe Workflow gives you the same power — open-source, flexible, and extendable:

- **Creative Professionals**: Build custom AI pipelines for high-volume asset production.
- **Studios**: Maintain brand consistency across hundreds of generative variations.
- **Developers**: Extend and integrate generative AI into any existing workflow via API.
- **Researchers**: Self-host and experiment with any AI model stack — no usage caps.

---

## Features

- **Node-Based AI Workflow Editor** — Visual, modular pipelines for generative AI, similar in spirit to Krea Nodes and Weavy AI workflows but fully open-source (inspired by Blender Nodes and ComfyUI).
- **Artistic Intelligence** — A design philosophy bridging human creativity and AI automation; the same creative-first approach seen in FloraFauna AI and Freepik Spaces.
- **Generative Image & Video** — Integrated support for image and video generation powered by **MuAPI** (Vadoo AI).
- **Self-Hosted & Private** — Run entirely on your own infrastructure. No data sent to third-party SaaS platforms.
- **Extensible Architecture** — Add new AI model nodes, connect external APIs, and build reusable workflow templates.
- **No Vendor Lock-in** — Swap AI providers freely. Unlike Freepik Spaces or FloraFauna AI, you own your stack.

---

## Use Cases

- **AI Image Generation Pipelines** — Build workflows comparable to Freepik Spaces AI tools or FloraFauna AI canvas, on your own server.
- **Video Generation Workflows** — Sequence and automate video generation jobs just like Krea Workflows.
- **Brand Asset Automation** — Replicate what Weavy AI does for enterprise content production, without the SaaS subscription.
- **Custom Model Integration** — Connect LoRAs, custom diffusion models, or any external API as a workflow node.
- **Creative Exploration** — Experiment with generative art pipelines in the same visual style as Krea Nodes or FloraFauna's node canvas.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For local development:
- **Node.js** (v20+)
- **Python** (v3.10+)
- **npm** (v7+ for workspaces support)

Or use **Docker** (see [Running with Docker](#running-with-docker)).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samuraigpt/vibe-workflow.git
   cd vibe-workflow
   ```

2. **Install all dependencies** (root directory):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This installs dependencies for the client, the workflow-builder library, and links them via npm workspaces.

### Configuration

Vibe Workflow uses **MuAPI** (Vadoo AI) for generative AI capabilities. You need an API key.

1. **Get your API Key** from [muapi.ai](https://muapi.ai) — sign up, navigate to **API Keys**, generate a key.

2. **Configure the Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   cp .env.example .env
   # Open .env and set:
   # MU_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

### Running the Project

**Frontend (Next.js):**
```bash
npm run dev:app
# Available at http://localhost:3000
```

**Backend (FastAPI):**
```bash
cd server
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## Running with Docker

The easiest way to run Vibe Workflow is with Docker Compose.

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** (v20+)
- **Docker Compose** (v2+)

### Quick Start

1. **Configure environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit `.env` and add your MuAPI key:
   ```bash
   MU_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Start all services**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

3. **Access the application**:
   - Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Backend API: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
   - API Docs: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

### Services

| Service | Image | Port |
|---------|-------|------|
| client | Node.js 24 Alpine | 3000 |
| server | Python 3.13 | 8000 |

### Stopping

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Development

- **Workflow-Builder Library** — To rebuild the core node editor:
  ```bash
  npm run build:lib
  ```
- **Client App** — Uses the local library. Rebuild the library after changes if not using a watcher:
  ```bash
  npm run dev:app
  ```

## Comparisons

### Vibe Workflow vs Weavy AI
Weavy AI is a proprietary node-based creative AI platform. Vibe Workflow is its open-source equivalent — same visual workflow paradigm, fully self-hostable, MIT licensed, with no subscription fees.

### Vibe Workflow vs Krea Nodes / Krea Workflows
Krea Nodes offers a powerful real-time generative canvas. Vibe Workflow brings a comparable node-based editor that is open-source, customizable, and extendable with any AI backend.

### Vibe Workflow vs Freepik Spaces
Freepik Spaces is a cloud-based AI creative suite integrated with Freepik's asset library. Vibe Workflow provides the workflow and pipeline layer as open-source infrastructure you control, with no asset-library lock-in.

### Vibe Workflow vs FloraFauna AI
FloraFauna AI offers a creative node canvas for generative media. Vibe Workflow replicates and extends that concept in an open-source, self-hosted package with full extensibility.
