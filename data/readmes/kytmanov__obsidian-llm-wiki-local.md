**Turn your raw notes into a self-improving, interlinked wiki — powered by a local LLM.**

Drop a markdown file into a folder. The pipeline reads it, extracts concepts, and creates or updates wiki articles. If a draft is wrong, reject it and explain why; the next compile addresses your feedback. Over time, every note you add and every draft you review makes the wiki smarter.

**Local-first, provider-flexible.** Runs 100% locally with [Ollama](https://ollama.com) by default. Also works with any OpenAI-compatible endpoint — Groq, Together AI, LM Studio, vLLM, Azure OpenAI, and [more](#providers).

## The idea (Karpathy's LLM Wiki)

This project is a practical implementation of the pattern described by Andrej Karpathy in [**"The LLM Wiki"**](https://karpathy.ai/llmwiki) — a vision for a personal knowledge base where:

> *"The LLM doesn't just store what you tell it — it synthesizes, cross-references, and keeps everything current. You add raw material; it does the bookkeeping."*

The key insight: treat your notes as **source material**, not as the final artifact. The LLM compiles them into a structured wiki that grows smarter as you add more. Unlike a chatbot that forgets, the wiki **persists and compounds**.

```
You write raw notes  →  LLM extracts concepts  →  Wiki articles created/updated
     raw/                    (automatic)                    wiki/
  quantum.md          "Qubit", "Superposition"       Qubit.md   ←──┐
  ml-basics.md        "Neural Network", "SGD"    Superposition.md  │
  physics.md          "Qubit" (again!)           Neural Network.md │
                                                      ↑  linked via [[wikilinks]]
```

The wiki lives in Obsidian, so you get the graph view, backlinks, and Dataview queries for free.

---

## Features

**Incremental compiles.** Each concept gets its own article. When you change a source note, only the articles tied to that note recompile, not the whole vault.

**File watcher.** Run `olw watch` once and it processes anything you drop into `raw/` automatically. Ingest and compile run in the background, so the wiki keeps improving while you keep writing notes.

**Rejection feedback.** Reject a draft and attach a reason. The next compile of that concept includes your feedback in the prompt, so the model can address it. Five rejections without an approval auto-blocks the concept until you re-enable it.

**Hand-edits are preserved.** Edit an article in Obsidian and the compiler will detect the change on the next run and skip it. Your edits aren't overwritten by regeneration.

**Query and synthesize.** `olw query "what is X?"` answers from your published wiki without embeddings or a vector DB. With `--synthesize` it saves the answer as a permanent wiki page, complete with source hashes and the same hand-edit protection.

**Self-maintenance.** Aliases like `PC` for `Program Counter` are extracted at ingest and used to repair broken wikilinks. `olw lint` reports orphans and stale articles; `olw maintain --fix` rewrites alias links and creates stubs for missing targets.

**Provider-flexible.** Ollama by default, fully offline. You can also point it at Groq, Together AI, LM Studio, vLLM, Azure OpenAI, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint via `olw setup`. `olw compare` previews a switch in isolated vaults so you can decide before editing `wiki.toml`.

**Multi-language.** Each note's language is auto-detected at ingest and the article is written in that language. Extraction rules don't depend on hard-coded word lists, so any language works.

**Git-aware.** Every automatic action commits with an `[olw]` prefix, and `olw undo` reverts the last one. Raw notes are never modified; `olw` only writes to `wiki/` and `.olw/`.

## Quick start

### 1. Install

**From PyPI** (recommended):

```bash
pip install obsidian-llm-wiki
```

Or with `uv`:

```bash
uv tool install obsidian-llm-wiki
```

**From source** (latest development version):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kytmanov/obsidian-llm-wiki-local
cd obsidian-llm-wiki-local
python install.py
```

`install.py` detects `uv` or falls back to `pip`, verifies the install, and tells you to run the next step.

### 2. Install and start Ollama

```bash
# Install Ollama: https://ollama.com/download
ollama pull gemma4:e4b      # fast model — analysis and routing
ollama pull qwen2.5:14b     # heavy model — article writing (optional, 7B+ recommended)
```

> **Minimal setup:** pull only `gemma4:e4b` and set both `fast` and `heavy` to it in the wizard.

### 3. Run the setup wizard

```bash
olw setup
```

An interactive wizard selects a provider, configures the URL and optional API key, picks fast and heavy models, sets an optional default vault, and offers experimental features. Takes ~30 seconds.

```
╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│      obsidian-llm-wiki  ·  setup                 │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

  Step 1  Provider

    Local (no API key needed):
       1. Ollama          http://localhost:11434  [default]
       2. LM Studio       http://localhost:1234/v1
       3. vLLM            http://localhost:8000/v1
       ...
    Cloud (API key required):
      10. Groq            https://api.groq.com/openai/v1
      11. Together AI     https://api.together.xyz/v1
      ...

    Select provider (number or name) [1]: _

  Step 2  URL
    Base URL [http://localhost:11434]: _
    ✓ connected

  Step 3  Fast model  (analysis & routing · 3–8B recommended)
    #  Model           Size
    1  gemma4:e4b      9.6 GB
    2  phi4-mini       2.5 GB
    Select (number or name) [1]: _
  ...
```

Settings are saved to `~/.config/olw/config.toml` (Mac/Linux) or `%APPDATA%\olw\config.toml` (Windows). API keys are stored only in this user-private file, never in `wiki.toml`.

Experimental setup choices are saved only as defaults for new vaults. Runtime behavior is controlled by each vault's `wiki.toml`.

### 4. Set up your vault

```bash
olw init ~/my-wiki
```

This creates the folder structure and a `wiki.toml` pre-filled with your setup wizard choices.

To enable experimental inline source citations for an existing vault:

```bash
olw config inline-source-citations on --vault ~/my-wiki
olw config inline-source-citations status --vault ~/my-wiki
```

Turn them off at any time with:

```bash
olw config inline-source-citations off --vault ~/my-wiki
```

Manual fallback:

```toml
[pipeline]
inline_source_citations = true
```

### 5. Add some notes

Drop any `.md` files into `~/my-wiki/raw/`. Web clips, book notes, meeting notes, anything.

```
~/my-wiki/raw/
  quantum-computing.md
  ml-fundamentals.md
  physics-lecture.md
```

### 6. Run the full pipeline

```bash
# One command: ingest + compile + lint + optional auto-approve
olw run

# Or step by step:
olw ingest --all
olw compile
olw review        # interactive draft review
```

If you set a default vault in `olw setup`, the `--vault` flag is optional. Otherwise use `--vault ~/my-wiki` or `export OLW_VAULT=~/my-wiki`.

Open `~/my-wiki` as an Obsidian vault. The graph view shows your connected wiki.
Before approving drafts, use a draft-review graph filter:

```text
-path:raw -path:wiki/sources -path:_resources -file:Welcome
```

After approving drafts, use a published-only graph filter:

```text
-path:raw -path:wiki/sources -path:wiki/.drafts -path:_resources -file:Welcome
```

The published-only filter hides `wiki/.drafts`, so it will look empty until drafts are approved. Run `olw doctor` to print graph guidance for the current vault.

Want to preview a model or provider switch before changing `wiki.toml`?

```bash
olw compare --heavy-model qwen2.5:14b
```

`olw compare` rebuilds isolated preview vaults from the same `raw/` notes and tells you whether to switch, keep your current config, or review the diffs manually.

### 7. Keep it running (optional)

```bash
olw watch
# Drop a file in raw/ → ingest + compile happen automatically (selective: only linked concepts)
```

---

## Query synthesis

`olw query` answers from the published wiki without embeddings. Use `--save` to keep a dated Q&A note in `wiki/queries/`, or `--synthesize` to publish a reusable synthesis page in `wiki/synthesis/`.

```bash
# Just answer in the terminal
olw query "What is backpropagation?"

# Save a dated Q&A note under wiki/queries/
olw query "What is backpropagation?" --save

# Save a reusable synthesis article under wiki/synthesis/
olw query "What is backpropagation?" --synthesize
```

Synthesis behavior:

- synthesis pages are published notes tagged with `synthesis`
- they store the source question, selected source pages, and source page body hashes in frontmatter
- `wiki/index.md` includes a capped `## Synthesis` section sourced from the DB, ordered by newest first and then title
- compare runs stay side-effect-free: query evaluation never writes to the active vault during `olw compare`
- query-time synthesis does not create a new `[olw]` git commit

Duplicate handling:

- default behavior is `keep_existing` for the same normalized question
- interactive terminals only prompt for a strategy when a duplicate already exists
- `save_with_suffix` keeps the existing page and writes a new suffixed file
- `update_in_place` rewrites the existing synthesis only when its body still matches the DB-tracked hash
- if the existing synthesis was manually edited, `update_in_place` refuses to overwrite it
- synthesis pages cannot cite another synthesis page as a source

---

## Compare a new model or provider

`olw compare` is a vault switch advisor, not a benchmark harness. It compares your
current vault config against one challenger config using the same active vault and
the same `raw/` notes.

```bash
# Same provider, different heavy model
olw compare --heavy-model qwen2.5:14b

# Try a different local provider
olw compare \
  --provider lm_studio \
  --provider-url http://localhost:1234/v1 \
  --fast-model google/gemma-4-e4b \
  --heavy-model google/gemma-4-e4b

# Quick spot-check on a large vault
olw compare --heavy-model qwen2.5:14b --sample-n 20
```

What it does:

- rebuilds the current config and challenger config in isolated preview vaults
- writes reports under `.olw/compare/<run_id>/`
- leaves your active `raw/` and `wiki/` untouched and does not modify active `.olw/` state outside `.olw/compare/`
- returns one verdict: `switch`, `keep_current`, or `manual_review`

Useful options:

- `--queries path/to/queries.toml` adds a few representative questions to the comparison
- `--out /tmp/my-compare` writes artifacts outside the vault if you want to inspect them elsewhere
- `--keep-artifacts` retains the ephemeral preview vaults instead of deleting them after the run
- `--sample-n N` limits the preview to the first `N` raw notes for a fast spot-check
- `--allow-cloud-upload` is required when the challenger uses a cloud provider

Notes:

- compare previews automated generated output, not the final curated vault after human review
- the report includes a ready-to-copy `wiki.toml` snippet for the challenger when the verdict is `switch`

Minimal `queries.toml` example:

```toml
[[query]]
id = "backprop"
question = "What is backpropagation?"
expected_contains = ["chain rule"]
```

Reports are written as Markdown and JSON by default:

- `report.md` — recommendation-first summary with next steps
- `report.json` — full machine-readable report
- `summary.json` — compact verdict and reason summary

---

## How it works

The pipeline has three stages, each using the LLM for a different purpose:

```
raw/note.md
    │
    ▼ olw ingest  (or olw run)
    Fast LLM (3B–8B)
    • Reads note
    • Extracts concept names
    • Preserves explicitly evidenced named references as knowledge item candidates
    • Writes quality score + summary to state.db
    • Creates wiki/sources/Note.md (source summary page)
    │
    ▼ olw compile
    Heavy LLM (7B–14B)
    • For each concept: gathers all source notes that mention it
    • Injects rejection feedback from previous reviews into the prompt
    • Writes a wiki article with [[wikilinks]] to related concepts
    • Adds quality annotations if confidence is low or sources are sparse
    • Lands in wiki/.drafts/ for review
    │
    ▼ olw review  (or olw approve)
    • Interactive numbered menu — approve / reject / diff / edit
    • Rejection feedback stored and injected into next compile
    • On approve: annotations stripped, article published to wiki/
    • Updates wiki/index.md (navigation layer)
    • Git commits the change
```

**No vector databases, no embeddings.** `wiki/index.md` acts as the routing layer for `olw query`. This keeps the setup simple and works well up to ~100 source notes.

The pipeline is intentionally conservative. Strong concepts become draft articles; explicitly evidenced named references become auditable knowledge item candidates. This keeps source-specific names visible without generating low-evidence articles from them.

---

## Multi-language support

`olw` detects the language of each raw note during ingest and stores it. At compile time, the article is written in that language — no configuration needed.

Extraction and cleanup are designed to be language-agnostic. The pipeline avoids hard-coded natural-language word lists for title/entity promotion. Instead, it uses structural evidence, explicit source evidence, and conservative confidence levels so notes in any language follow the same rules.

**How it works:**

1. **Ingest** — the fast model detects the primary language and stores an ISO 639-1 code (`en`, `fr`, `de`, …) per note in the state DB.
2. **Compile** — when all source notes for a concept share the same language, the heavy model is instructed to write the article in that language. If sources are mixed, it falls back to matching the source text.
3. **Config override** — set `language` in `wiki.toml` to force a specific output language for the whole vault, regardless of what the model detected.

```toml
[pipeline]
language = "fr"   # all articles will be written in French
```

Leave `language` unset (the default) to let auto-detection drive it per concept.

**Example:** a French note ingested alongside English notes produces a French article for French-only concepts and an English article for concepts sourced from English notes. Setting `language = "en"` forces everything to English.

This language setting controls generated article language only. It does not enable language-specific concept merging or ontology decisions.

---

## Knowledge item candidates

Not every useful reference deserves a wiki article. During ingest, `olw` keeps a separate knowledge item ledger for ambiguous, low-evidence references found explicitly in notes:

- LLM-proposed named references accepted only when the exact text appears in the title, filename, or body
- structurally prominent quoted titles, such as `"A Practical Guide To Notes"`
- confirmed concepts mirrored into the ledger as confirmed knowledge items

These items are not compiled into articles by default. They are preserved for later review, classification, or future evidence accumulation.

```bash
olw items audit
olw items show "Example Reference"
```

This is deliberately conservative: a named reference should not become a concept article unless the source content supports it. The item ledger keeps the reference from disappearing while avoiding hallucinated articles.

---

## Rejection feedback loop

When you reject a draft:

```bash
olw review
# Select draft → [r]eject → "The overview section is too vague, needs concrete examples"
```

The feedback is stored in the state database. On the next compile of that concept, the prompt includes:

```
PREVIOUS REJECTIONS — address these issues:
- The overview section is too vague, needs concrete examples
```

After 5 rejections of the same concept without an approval, the concept is **auto-blocked** and excluded from future compiles until you explicitly re-enable it:

```bash
olw unblock "Quantum Computing"
```

---

## Draft annotations

Drafts with low confidence or sparse sources are annotated with HTML comments that are invisible in Obsidian's preview but visible in the editor:

```markdown
<!-- olw-auto: low-confidence (0.32) — verify before publishing -->
<!-- olw-auto: single-source — cross-reference recommended -->

## Overview
...
```

Annotations are stripped automatically when you approve a draft. `olw review` surfaces them as a warning in the draft list.

## Vault structure

```

```

`raw/` is immutable — `olw` never writes to it. All metadata lives in `state.db`.

---

## Configuration

`wiki.toml` (created by `olw init`):

```toml
[models]
fast  = "gemma4:e4b"      # extraction, analysis, query routing
heavy = "qwen2.5:14b"     # article generation, Q&A answers
# Single-model: set heavy = fast

# ── Local Ollama (default) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[ollama]
url = "http://localhost:11434"   # supports LAN: http://192.168.1.x:11434
timeout = 600
fast_ctx = 16384                 # context window for fast model (tokens)
heavy_ctx = 32768                # context window for heavy model (tokens)

# ── Any other provider (replaces [ollama] when present) ──────────────────────
# [provider]
# name = "groq"                              # or lm_studio, vllm, together, azure, custom …
# url  = "https://api.groq.com/openai/v1"
# timeout = 120
# fast_ctx = 8192
# heavy_ctx = 32768
# azure_api_version = "2024-02-15-preview"  # Azure only

[pipeline]
auto_approve = false             # true = skip draft review
auto_commit = true               # git commit after each operation
auto_maintain = false            # true = run maintain checks after each compile
max_concepts_per_source = 8      # limit concepts extracted per note
watch_debounce = 3.0             # seconds after last file event before processing
ingest_parallel = false          # true = parallel chunk analysis (needs OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL>=4)
# language = "en"               # ISO 639-1 output language; autodetects from notes if unset
# inline_source_citations = false
# source_citation_style = "legend-only"  # legend-only | inline-wikilink
# draft_media = "reference"              # reference | embed | omit
```

> **API keys** are never stored in `wiki.toml`. They are read at runtime from the provider-specific env var (e.g. `GROQ_API_KEY`), the generic `OLW_API_KEY` env var, or the `api_key` field in `~/.config/olw/config.toml` (written by `olw setup`).

### Tuning context windows

`heavy_ctx` controls how much source material the heavy model reads when writing articles (`source budget = heavy_ctx / 2` chars) and how long the generated article can be. Defaults target **16 GB VRAM**. **If you use a model with a large context window (e.g. `gemma4:e4b` supports 128K), increase it.**

| VRAM | Recommended `heavy_ctx` | Source budget | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8 GB | `8192` | ~4K chars | Minimum; short articles |
| 16 GB | `32768` | ~16K chars | Default |
| 32 GB+ | `65536` | ~32K chars | Rich multi-source articles |

`fast_ctx` controls ingest analysis. Notes longer than `fast_ctx / 2` chars are automatically split into chunks and analyzed in sequence — all content is covered, no truncation.

| VRAM | Recommended `fast_ctx` | Notes per chunk |
|---|---|---|
| 8 GB | `8192` | ~4K chars |
| 16 GB | `16384` | ~8K chars — Default |
| 32 GB+ | `32768` | ~16K chars |

### Speeding up long-note ingest

For vaults with many long notes (>8K chars), enable parallel chunk analysis:

```toml
[pipeline]
ingest_parallel = true   # requires OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL>=4
```

Also set in your shell before starting Ollama:

```bash
OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=4 ollama serve
```

This lets Ollama process multiple chunks simultaneously. On 16 GB VRAM with `gemma4:e4b` (9.6 GB), 4 parallel slots fit comfortably (~12.8 GB total). Wall time for a 25K-char note drops from ~39s to ~14s.

After editing `wiki.toml`, no reinstall is needed. Run `olw compile --force` to regenerate articles with the new context budget.

RAG (embeddings) requires a provider that supports `/v1/embeddings`. The default index-based query works with all providers.

## Model recommendations

| Role | Ollama | Cloud |
|------|--------|-------|
| Fast (analysis + routing) | `gemma4:e4b`, `llama3.2:3b` | `llama-3.1-8b-instant` (Groq), `mistral-7b` |
| Heavy (article writing) | `qwen2.5:14b`, `llama3.1:8b` | `llama-3.3-70b` (Groq), `mistral-large` |
| Single model (everything) | `llama3.1:8b`, `mistral:7b` | any 7B+ |

Any model with JSON format / `response_format: json_object` support works. The tool degrades gracefully with smaller models.

## Obsidian tips

- **Graph view** — concept pages link to source pages and each other via `[[wikilinks]]`; before approval use `-path:raw -path:wiki/sources -path:_resources -file:Welcome`, after approval add `-path:wiki/.drafts`
- **Source citations** — when inline citations are enabled, the default style stays graph-quiet as `[S1](#Sources)` links while source pages link once in `## Sources`; set `source_citation_style = "inline-wikilink"` if you want every citation to create a source edge
- **Media** — source pages preserve `![[media]]` embeds; generated drafts default to plain media references to avoid attachment nodes dominating the graph (`draft_media = "reference"`)
- **Draft review** — drafts live in `wiki/.drafts/` and may not appear in Obsidian's default graph filters; use `olw doctor` for the recommended draft-review and published-only filters
- **Dataview** — query by `status: published`, `confidence: > 0.7`, `tags: [physics]`, etc.
- **Backlinks** — every concept page shows which source pages mention it
- **Web Clipper** — save web articles directly to `raw/` (see [docs/web-clipper-setup.md](docs/web-clipper-setup.md))

## Quality principles for contributors and AI agents

- Prefer deterministic, auditable cleanup over broad LLM-driven merging.
- Do not use LLM aliases as automatic merge authority; aliases are weak evidence.
- Keep concept extraction language-agnostic. Avoid hard-coded English or other language-specific word lists unless the feature is explicitly scoped to that language.
- Preserve weak entity references as knowledge item candidates rather than generating unsupported concept articles.
- Source pages and `[S1](#Sources)` citations should remain graph-quiet by default; source-page edges belong in `## Sources`.
- Generated drafts should avoid media embeds by default. Source pages can preserve embeds; draft articles should usually contain plain media references.
- Raw notes are immutable. All generated state belongs under `wiki/` and `.olw/`.

## Running the tests

All tests are offline — no Ollama required.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kytmanov/obsidian-llm-wiki-local
cd obsidian-llm-wiki-local
uv sync --group dev
uv run pytest
```

For the full end-to-end smoke test (requires a running provider):

```bash
# Ollama (default)
bash scripts/smoke_test.sh

# LM Studio or any other OpenAI-compatible endpoint
PROVIDER=lm_studio bash scripts/smoke_test.sh

# LM Studio with the validated local baseline model
PROVIDER=lm_studio FAST_MODEL=gemma4:e4b HEAVY_MODEL=gemma4:e4b \
bash scripts/smoke_test.sh

# Compare smoke test
PROVIDER=lm_studio FAST_MODEL=gemma4:e4b HEAVY_MODEL=gemma4:e4b \
bash scripts/compare_smoke.sh
```

If LM Studio rejects the short alias, use the exact loaded model id it reports, for example `google/gemma-4-e4b`.

## FAQ

**Q: I ran `olw compile` but nothing appears in Obsidian.**

Drafts land in `wiki/.drafts/` — Obsidian hides dotfolders by default so they won't show in the graph yet. Run:

```bash
olw review        # interactive review
# or
olw approve --all
```

Articles move to `wiki/` and become fully visible.

---

**Q: Compile says "2 article(s) failed: Methodology, Sprints" — what do I do?**

Failed concepts are retried automatically on the next run. Or force a retry:

```bash
olw compile --retry-failed
```

If the same concepts keep failing, the LLM is likely struggling with JSON output for those specific titles. Try increasing `heavy_ctx` in `wiki.toml` (see [Tuning context windows](#tuning-context-windows)).

---

**Q: I see `structured_output attempt N failed` messages during compile — is something broken?**

No. This is the built-in 3-tier retry system working as designed. The model occasionally echoes the JSON schema structure instead of flat output — the retry corrects it. Articles are still generated. A real failure surfaces as `article(s) failed: ...` in the summary line.

---

**Q: `olw ingest --all && olw compile` gives "Missing option '--vault'".**

Run `olw setup` first to configure a default vault, or pass it explicitly:

```bash
export OLW_VAULT=~/my-wiki
olw ingest --all && olw compile
```

---

**Q: I changed models in `olw setup` but `olw compile` still uses the old model.**

Re-run `olw init` on your vault — it syncs the model settings from your global config into `wiki.toml`:

```bash
olw init ~/my-wiki
```

---

**Q: A concept keeps getting rejected — how do I stop it from recompiling?**

After 5 rejections with feedback (`olw reject --feedback "…"`), the concept is auto-blocked and excluded from future compiles. `olw status` lists blocked concepts. To re-enable one:

```bash
olw unblock "Concept Name"
```

---

**Q: Can I use a cloud provider like Groq or Together AI instead of Ollama?**

Yes. Run `olw setup` and select the provider from the numbered list. Enter your API key when prompted — it is stored only in `~/.config/olw/config.toml`. Alternatively set the provider-specific env var before each command:

```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...
olw run
```

The pipeline, vault structure, and all `olw` commands work identically regardless of provider.

---

**Q: I changed providers in `olw setup` but `wiki.toml` still shows `[ollama]`.**

Re-run `olw init` on your vault to sync the global config into `wiki.toml`:

```bash
olw init ~/my-wiki
```

For existing vaults with a `[ollama]` section you can also add a `[provider]` block manually — it takes precedence over `[ollama]` when present.

## Why not just use a chatbot?

Chatbots forget. Every conversation starts fresh. This tool builds a **persistent artifact** — a wiki that grows with every note you add, that you can open in Obsidian, search, query, and edit by hand.

The LLM is a compiler, not a conversation partner. You give it raw material; it produces structured knowledge. The output is plain markdown files you own forever.
