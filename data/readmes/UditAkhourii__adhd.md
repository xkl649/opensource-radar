> **An architectural fix for premature convergence in autoregressive reasoning.**

Linear Chain-of-Thought anchors on whatever it says first. Tree-of-Thought widens the search but still walks a single shared context, so the anchoring persists across branches. **ADHD treats this as an architectural problem, not a prompting one** — it spawns N isolated reasoning processes under deliberately distorted cognitive frames, with zero shared context during divergence, then runs a separate critic pass to score, cluster, prune traps, and deepen the survivors.

Reach for it on **design decisions, fuzzy debugging, naming, API surface design, strategy, and any prompt of the shape *"give me a few ways to…"***.

## Side-by-side: baseline vs ADHD

One eval problem, same model, two strategies. Full transcripts in [`bench/results.json`](./bench/results.json).

> **Problem.** *"We have a CLI that calls an LLM and it sometimes hangs for 90 seconds. Design the right retry/timeout/UX strategy."*

<table>
<tr>
<th width="50%">🟦 Baseline (single-shot)</th>
<th width="50%">🟧 ADHD</th>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>

Walks through four **textbook** patterns:

1. Progressive timeout with staged UI (10s / 30s / 60s)
2. Fast-fail + exponential backoff retry
3. Hedged parallel requests
4. Streaming with keepalive

Lands on a **hybrid** recommendation — 15s first-token timeout, 30s between-token timeout, 90s absolute, one auto-retry. Sensible. Google SRE Book ch. 22. The answer a senior engineer gives in 30 seconds.

**What's missing:** no traps named, no acknowledgement that the *user* might want to bail out of a slow request, no questioning of the "wait then retry the same model" frame.

</td>
<td>

Spawns 6 isolated frames, surfaces a **wide set** of 30+ ideas across `economic-incentive`, `async-control-surface`, `gamification`, `perceptual-distortion`, `collective-intelligence`, `redundancy-race` clusters, then:

- ★ **Non-obvious pick:** *"rage-quit = instant abort + branch to cheaper/faster model"* — a button that pulses hotter the longer you wait. One click cancels and re-submits to Haiku-class. The thing baseline never considers: **the slow model might just be the wrong model for this prompt.**
- Plus shortlist: scout-fork to alternate endpoints at 30s; daemonize the CLI with ticket IDs; race 3 LLM replicas, cache the winner.
- **20 traps flagged with one-line reasons** — including the cute "stream tokens in reverse" and "patience-token billing" ideas before they cost engineering time.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

Independent LLM judge on this problem: **breadth 9 vs 6, novelty 8 vs 3, trap detection ~8 vs ~2.** Methodology in [documentation/evals.md](./documentation/evals.md).

## Featured

- 🔌 **Adopted by [repowire](https://github.com/prassanna-ravishankar/repowire)** — the first OSS project to officially ship ADHD. Its maintainer ported the framework onto repowire's mesh-orchestrator primitives in [PR #313](https://github.com/prassanna-ravishankar/repowire/pull/313) (merged): frames become frame-shifted temp peers, the generator/critic split maps onto separate peers vs. the orchestrator's own turn, attribution via `metadata.based-on` (MIT).
- 📰 **[The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/claude-code-adhd/)** ran a feature story on ADHD for Claude Code.
- 💬 **OpenClaw / multi-agent community** is independently testing it across agents. One tester: *"I read it, installed it on two different agents… I actually love it. This is great. I thought this was gonna be another useless post. But no, it wasn't."*
- 🔬 An independent **[evidence-based research review](https://github.com/testdouble/han/blob/adhd-swarm-research/docs/research/adhd-application-to-han.md)** (11 sources, 8 validation rounds) was published against the method — findings tracked openly as [issues #16–#18](https://github.com/UditAkhourii/adhd/issues).

## Early adopters

Projects that officially ship or integrate ADHD:

| Project | What they did | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [**repowire**](https://github.com/prassanna-ravishankar/repowire) | Ported ADHD onto repowire's mesh-orchestrator primitives — frames become frame-shifted temp peers, generator/critic split maps to separate peers vs. the orchestrator's turn. Ships in the default orchestrator template. ([PR #313](https://github.com/prassanna-ravishankar/repowire/pull/313)) | ✅ Merged · MIT attribution |
| [**mstack**](https://github.com/mayank-io/mstack) | Vendored ADHD as the `think` plugin in their Claude plugin marketplace — wires the divergent-then-converge loop into mstack for architecture, naming, API design, and fuzzy debugging. | ✅ Shipped · MIT attribution |
| [**zk-flow-oss**](https://github.com/matt-metivier/zk-flow-oss) | Adapted ADHD's `IDEATION_FRAMES` into their critique workflow ([`src/workflows/critique.src.js`](https://github.com/matt-metivier/zk-flow-oss/blob/main/src/workflows/critique.src.js)) as a pre-pass to reduce anchoring bias before review. | ✅ Shipped · MIT attribution |
| [**han**](https://github.com/testdouble/han) | Published an [evidence-based research application](https://github.com/testdouble/han/blob/adhd-swarm-research/docs/research/adhd-application-to-han.md) of ADHD onto Han's plugin model — 11 sources, 8 validation rounds. Findings landed as issues [#16](https://github.com/UditAkhourii/adhd/issues/16)–[#18](https://github.com/UditAkhourii/adhd/issues/18). | ✅ Research integration |
| [**app-library** (yslee5005)](https://github.com/yslee5005/app-library) | Built an `expert-thinker` MoAI agent on the ADHD pattern — tree-of-thought with isolated divergence and a separate critic pass. | ✅ Shipped |
| [**striatum**](https://github.com/halbritt/striatum) | Installer scaffold for Claude Code recommends `npx skills add UditAkhourii/adhd` for architecture, API design, and naming work. | ✅ Shipped |
| [**awesome-prompts**](https://github.com/ai-boost/awesome-prompts) | Packaged the ADHD loop as a standalone prompt (`adhd_parallel_ideation_skill.txt`) for users without the skill installed. | ✅ Shipped |
| [**nix-skills**](https://github.com/sudosubin/nix-skills) | Nix packaging of the ADHD skill (pinned to commit `770834e`) for the Nix-based agent-skills ecosystem. | ✅ Shipped |
| [**caioniehues/adhd**](https://github.com/caioniehues/adhd) | Fork with a customized `SKILL.md` that re-points install + docs to their own distribution while keeping upstream attribution. | ✅ Fork · attribution |
| [**ktg-one/adhd**](https://github.com/ktg-one/adhd) | Fork used as a personal "codified model of how my brain works" — wired into the [may-2026-kb](https://github.com/ktg-one/may-2026-kb) knowledge base as a cognitive-architecture pattern. | ✅ Fork · in use |
| [**wtfismyrepo**](https://github.com/nandnijaiswal/wtfismyrepo) | Uses ADHD as the explanation engine for codebase onboarding. The deterministic layer (import-graph PageRank, git-churn fragility, GitHub PR/issue signals) produces an analysis object that is formatted as an ADHD `problem` + `context`. The ADHD diverge→score→cluster→deepen loop then generates onboarding angles across 12 codebase-specific frames (`new-grad`, `archeologist`, `security-researcher`, `on-call-at-3am`, `refactorer`, `inversion`, …), scores them for fit to the developer's level + goal, prunes traps, and deepens the non-obvious pick into a full walkthrough. Ships the ADHD method in the Claude Code skill (`SKILL.md`) with zero extra deps — Claude runs the frames itself. | ✅ Shipped · MIT attribution |
| [**mythify**](https://github.com/hannsxpeter/mythify) | Added trap-clause and alternatives guidance to its analysis prompt packet after evaluating ADHD's divergent-frames-then-critic pattern — surfaces "the one that looks good but isn't, and why" before a plan is committed to. ([PR #18](https://github.com/hannsxpeter/mythify/pull/18)) | ✅ Merged |
| [**godaudits**](https://github.com/hannsxpeter/godaudits) | Shipped v2.11.0 adopting measurement and provenance discipline from an ADHD review — an independent refutation pass (`refute plan`/`apply`), severity-aware recall metrics, and attribution/limits tracking on eval results. ([PR #13](https://github.com/hannsxpeter/godaudits/pull/13)) | ✅ Shipped |
| [**godplans**](https://github.com/hannsxpeter/godplans) | Shipped v1.8.0 turning its self-audit into an independent audit gate (separate scoring pass, isolated context) and adding a no-skill baseline control arm to its eval harness, inspired by ADHD's generator/critic split — while explicitly rejecting the novelty-scoring axis and randomized frame selection as unsuited to its own goals. ([PR #8](https://github.com/hannsxpeter/godplans/pull/8)) | ✅ Shipped |
| [**Claude1.0** (Ro-Sama-33)](https://github.com/Ro-Sama-33/Claude1.0) | Installed the ADHD skill into `.agents/skills/adhd/`. ([PR #16](https://github.com/Ro-Sama-33/Claude1.0/pull/16)) | ✅ Installed |

## Install

One command, auto-detects your agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Antigravity, Codex, Cline, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, and ~50 more):

```bash
npx skills add UditAkhourii/adhd
```

Then invoke explicitly with `/adhd "your problem"`, or let it auto-trigger on ideation intents.

### Codex quick path

If the universal command above fails to register inside Codex (some Codex builds discover skills from a specific path), force the target:

```bash
npx skills add UditAkhourii/adhd -a codex -g
```

Or install manually into Codex's skills directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills/adhd
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UditAkhourii/adhd/main/skills/adhd/SKILL.md \
  -o ~/.codex/skills/adhd/SKILL.md
```

Restart Codex. `/adhd "design a rate limiter"` should now route through the skill. The skill ships with a single-line description (≤600 chars) specifically because some Codex builds truncate or reject multi-line YAML block descriptions.

CLI and library installs, manual curl for other agents, and per-platform paths are in **[documentation/install.md](./documentation/install.md)**.

```bash
npm install -g adhd-agent     # CLI
npm install adhd-agent        # library
```

---

## Quickstart

```bash
adhd "design a rate limiter that survives a leader election"
adhd "name this function" --frames 3 --ideas 8 --top 2
```

```ts
import { run, renderText } from "adhd-agent";

const result = await run({ problem: "How should we shard this queue under bursty load?", framesPerRun: 5, topK: 3 });
console.log(renderText(result));
// result.shortlist · result.nonObviousPick · result.traps · result.deepened · result.clusters
```

Full reference: **[documentation/api.md](./documentation/api.md)**.

## How it works

A two-phase loop with a hard wall between the phases.

1. **Diverge.** Pick N cognitive frames. Spawn N parallel, **isolated** Agent calls — each sees the problem plus one frame's vantage prompt, and a system prompt that forbids evaluation. Branches never see each other, so no anchoring.
2. **Focus.** A separate critic call scores every idea (`novelty / viability / fit`), flags traps with reasons, clusters by underlying angle, and deepens the top-K survivors into sketches with risks and first steps.

The generator-critic split is **mechanical** — separate LLM calls with opposite system prompts — not promised in one prompt. Deep dive: **[documentation/how-it-works.md](./documentation/how-it-works.md)**. How it differs from CoT and ToT: **[documentation/vs-cot-and-tot.md](./documentation/vs-cot-and-tot.md)**.

## Results

Mean scores across 6 open-ended engineering problems (0–10), ADHD vs a single-shot baseline at the same model, judged by an independent LLM with a skeptical-staff-engineer prompt, A/B order randomized.

| Dimension          | ADHD     | Baseline | Δ         | Ratio |
| ------------------ | -------: | -------: | --------: | ----: |
| breadth            | **9.00** | 4.83     | **+4.17** | 1.9×  |
| novelty            | **7.83** | 2.67     | **+5.17** | 2.9×  |
| trap detection     | **9.50** | 1.83     | **+7.67** | 5.2×  |
| actionability      | **9.50** | 6.50     | **+3.00** | 1.5×  |
| builder usefulness | **7.67** | 6.83     | **+0.83** | 1.1×  |

**ADHD wins 5 of 6 problems.** Biggest gap is trap detection — baselines rarely name the seductive-but-broken ideas. Methodology, limitations, and how to reproduce: **[documentation/evals.md](./documentation/evals.md)**.
