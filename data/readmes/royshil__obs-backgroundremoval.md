## How to build from source

**Windows**:

```pwsh
git clone https://github.com/royshil/obs-backgroundremoval.git
```

**Platforms we support building from source officially:**

```
git clone https://github.com/royshil/obs-backgroundremoval.git
cd obs-backgroundremoval
sudo ./bin/bootstrap
./bin/setup
./bin/build
sudo dpkg -i release/obs-backgroundremoval-*-linux-gnu.deb
```

The supported platforms are:

- Debian Forky (x86_64 and arm64)

We plan to add building scripts for popular platforms such as Windows, Mac, and various distributions of Linux.

## Introduction

This plugin is meant to make it easy to replace the background in portrait images and video.
It is using a neural network to predict the mask of the portrait and remove the background pixels.
It's easily composable with other OBS plugins to replace the background with e.g. an image or
a transparent color.

### Technical Details

GPU support:

- On Windows, we plan to support WinML acceleration.
- On Mac we support CoreML for acceleration, which is efficient on Apple Silicon. **Note:** This plugin does not support cross-architecture translation (Rosetta2). Intel binaries on Apple Silicon or Apple Silicon binaries on Intel will crash.
- On Linux CUDA, ROCM (deprecated in ONNX Runtime 1.23.0), and MIGraphX are supported if this plugin is built from source. Ensure your ONNX Runtime installation has CUDA, ROCM, or MIGraphX support. For AMD GPUs, MIGraphX is recommended as ROCM was removed from ONNX Runtime starting with version 1.23.0.
- The goal of this plugin is to be available for everyone on every system, even if they don't own a GPU.

Number of CPU threads is controllable through the UI settings. A 2-thread setting works best.
