## Online Training Notebooks

WalkingLab is collaborating with ModelScope to provide online training environments for classic reinforcement learning experiments. A ModelScope Studio brings the experiment interface, runtime, and training entry point together on one page, so learners can start training in a browser and observe the agent without first configuring a local environment.

Every Studio has a companion notebook under [`code/online-experiments`](code/online-experiments/README.md). The notebook imports the same training runtime as the Studio, exposes the experiment parameters, prints the full training log, plots checkpoint evaluations, and displays the learned-policy replay or result artifact.

## About This Book

Reinforcement learning studies a simple but difficult problem: a system acts, observes the consequences, and uses them to improve its next action. When rewards arrive late, observations are incomplete, and each update changes the distribution of future experience, the familiar supervised-learning model of inputs and labels is no longer enough. We need a language for interaction, a way to estimate long-term return, and methods that improve a policy stably from limited data.

**Hands-On Modern RL** follows that problem from beginning to end. CartPole and multi-armed bandits first make states, actions, rewards, and policies observable. Markov decision processes, value functions, and Bellman equations then provide a common language. From there, the book develops DQN, policy gradients, actor-critic methods, PPO, continuous control, and offline reinforcement learning. With those foundations in place, RLHF, DPO, GRPO, and RLVR become extensions of the same sequential-decision framework rather than an isolated collection of acronyms.

The second half expands the environment to tools, browsers, code repositories, vision, and audio. An action may be a passage of text, a function call, or a sequence of interface operations. A reward may come from human preference, a rule-based verifier, or a process reward model. The setting changes, but three questions run through the entire book: **How should the decision process be represented? How should an outcome be credited to earlier actions? How can we tell whether a policy has actually improved?**

### How the Material Is Taught

Each chapter follows a problem–method–experiment–reflection rhythm. A concrete task first exposes the difficulty. The concepts and equations needed to solve it come next. Runnable code, training curves, and evaluation metrics then test the argument. The chapter closes by examining assumptions, failure modes, and the limits of the method. Mathematics explains observed behavior; experiments check the mathematics.

Implementations retain the visible skeleton of each algorithm. Readers can trace trajectory collection, advantage estimation, loss construction, and metric changes—and see how reward hacking, KL drift, entropy collapse, distribution shift, or evaluation leakage can invalidate an apparently successful run.

### Who Should Read It

This book is for students, researchers, and engineers with basic machine-learning experience who want a systematic understanding of modern reinforcement learning. Readers should be comfortable with Python and basic PyTorch, and should know introductory linear algebra, probability, and calculus. The mathematical appendices rebuild these tools to the depth required by the chapters, so a separate advanced-mathematics sequence is not a prerequisite.

After completing the core chapters and labs, you should be able to:

- formulate a new decision problem using MDPs, value functions, Bellman equations, and credit assignment;
- implement, read, and diagnose DQN, REINFORCE, actor-critic methods, PPO, DPO, and GRPO;
- explain how SFT, reward modeling, preference optimization, RLHF, and RLVR fit together in LLM post-training;
- design trajectories, rewards, training loops, and evaluation protocols for tool-use, code, and multimodal agents;
- identify failure modes behind training curves and test proposed improvements with controlled experiments.

- [x] **Late May 2026:** Improve reproducible LLM RL experiments and add a full RLVR hands-on module with evaluation.
- [ ] **Early June 2026:** Deliver Agentic RL projects step by step, from single-tool use to complex Deep Research trajectory synthesis.
- [ ] **Late June 2026:** Add Unity-based embodied RL environments and trainable project examples.
- [ ] **July 2026 and later:** Expand multimodal frontier content with full VLM RL or Diffusion RL hands-on cases.

## Structure of the Book

The book contains seven parts and twenty-six chapters. Parts I–III establish the common language and algorithmic foundations of reinforcement learning. Part IV brings those tools into LLM post-training. Parts V and VI study what changes when the action space expands to tools and multimodal environments. Part VII asks how to detect failures, build trustworthy evaluations, and move the research frontier forward. The appendices provide implementation, mathematics, and engineering references.

### Prologue: From Trial and Error to Modern Agents

| Reading                                                                    | Central question                                                                               |

### Part I: The Language of Sequential Decisions

The book first makes an agent's failures and improvements observable, then develops the mathematical objects needed to describe long-term decisions.

| Ch. | Topic                                                                        | Through line                                                                                        |

|  2  | [RL Problems and Definitions](docs/chapter03_mdp/bandit.md)                  | Move from exploration and exploitation to MDPs, returns, trajectories, and partial observability.   |

### Part II: Learning Values and Policies with Neural Networks

When the state space grows, tables no longer suffice. This part introduces function approximation and follows the value-learning and policy-learning routes into PPO and continuous control.

| Ch. | Topic                                                                             | Through line                                                                                           |

### Part III: Expanding the Data, Task, and Agent

When interaction is expensive, expert demonstrations are available, or a task spans multiple agents and time scales, the object of learning changes.

| Ch. | Topic                                                                                                  | Through line                                                                             |
| :-: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| 11  | [Imitation, Inverse RL, and Meta-RL](docs/chapter13_imitation_meta_rl/bc-dagger.md)                    | Learn policies or rewards from experts and adapt to new tasks.                           |
| 12  | [Exploration, Multi-Agent, and Hierarchical RL](docs/chapter14_exploration_marl_hierarchical/intro.md) | Address sparse rewards, coordination, and the hierarchy of long-horizon tasks.           |

### Part IV: LLM Alignment and Post-Training

Language models expand an “action” into a passage of text. Policy optimization, distribution constraints, and credit assignment now lead into preference alignment, verifiable rewards, and inference-time computation.

| Ch. | Topic                                                                                        | Through line                                                                                                 |

### Part V: Tool Use and Agentic Reinforcement Learning

Once agents call tools across many environment steps, the unit of training becomes a trajectory. Credit assignment, environment construction, and safety boundaries become central.

| Ch. | Topic                                                                                         | Through line                                                                           |

### Part VI: Reinforcement Learning in Multimodal Worlds

Vision, audio, robot actions, and generative models introduce new state representations, reward sources, and evaluation criteria.

| Ch. | Topic                                                                                           | Through line                                                                        |

### Part VII: Safety, Evaluation, and Research Frontiers

A rising training reward only shows that the optimizer met its objective. This final part asks whether the objective was sound, whether the gain was real, and what new risks follow from broader capabilities.

| Ch. | Topic                                                                                            | Through line                                                                                   |

## Recommended Learning Path

For a first systematic reading, follow the chapters in order. Chapters 1–4 establish the language and recursive ideas of RL; Chapters 5–9 develop the algorithmic core of deep RL; Chapters 10–12 expand the data and task settings. Together, these parts provide the foundation for the rest of the book.

Readers focused on LLM post-training can enter Chapters 13–18 after completing Chapters 6–8. Policy gradients, advantage estimation, PPO, and KL constraints directly explain the objectives used by RLHF, DPO, and GRPO. Then select the relevant topics from Chapters 19–24 for Agentic or multimodal RL. Chapters 25–26 are worth reading alongside any experiment because reward and evaluation errors affect every method in the book.

For each chapter: restate the problem it solves, derive the central equation, run at least one experiment, and change one important assumption to explain the resulting metrics. Use the appendices as references when mathematics or engineering details arise; they do not need to be read front to back first.

## Quick Start

### Read Online

Published course site:

```text
https://walkinglabs.github.io/hands-on-modern-rl/
```

### Run the Documentation Site Locally

Requirements:

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- npm

```bash
git clone https://github.com/walkinglabs/hands-on-modern-rl.git
cd hands-on-modern-rl
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the local VitePress URL shown in the terminal, usually:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

### Verify the Site

Before submitting a pull request that changes documentation structure, theme code, navigation, build scripts, or generated assets, run:

```bash
npm run verify
```

This checks formatting, lints the VitePress theme, builds the site, and verifies expected build artifacts.

### Run Course Code

Most code examples use Python and are organized by chapter.

```bash
cd code
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For smaller installs, use chapter-specific requirements files:

```bash
pip install -r chapter01_cartpole/requirements.txt
python chapter01_cartpole/1-ppo_cartpole.py
```

Some chapters may require additional system libraries, GPU support, model downloads, or environment-specific setup. Start with Chapter 01 before running examples that involve LLMs, VLMs, or heavy simulators.

## Contributing

Contributions should make the course clearer, more accurate, easier to reproduce, or easier to navigate.

Good contributions include:

- Fixing conceptual errors, formulas, diagrams, broken links, or typos.
- Improving explanations without changing the intended learning path.
- Adding small, reproducible experiments that clarify existing chapters.
- Improving scripts, build reliability, navigation, or accessibility.
- Adding high-quality references to papers, official documentation, or widely used open-source implementations.

Please keep pull requests focused. A good PR usually changes one chapter, one experiment, one group of diagrams, or one infrastructure issue at a time.

When adding content:

1. Put course material under [`docs/`](docs/).
2. Use kebab-case for new directories and files.
3. Prefer directory-based routes with `index.md`.
4. Update [`docs/.vitepress/config.mjs`](docs/.vitepress/config.mjs) when adding navigable pages.
5. Run `npm run verify` before requesting review if your change touches config, theme, scripts, or generated site output.
6. Use Conventional Commits, such as `docs: clarify ppo clipping` or `fix: repair chapter link`.

For repository-specific maintenance rules, see [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).
