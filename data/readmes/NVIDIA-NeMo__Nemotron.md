## Use from Claude Code

This repo ships a Claude Code plugin called **`nemotron-customize`** that turns the step catalog under [`src/nemotron/steps/`](./src/nemotron/steps/) into a guided, repo-native pipeline builder.

Install once:

```text
/plugin marketplace add NVIDIA/Nemotron
/plugin install nemotron-customize@nvidia-nemotron
```

Then, **start Claude Code from the repo root** and invoke the skill:

```bash
cd /path/to/Nemotron        # repo root: must contain pyproject.toml and src/nemotron/steps/
claude
```

```text
/nemotron-customize
```

The skill resolves all file paths against your current working directory, so it must be invoked from the Nemotron checkout root. Running it from a subdirectory will cause file reads to fail.

The skill plans the step DAG, validates artifact wiring, and emits the YAML configs needed to run the requested pipeline. See [`skills/nemotron-customize/SKILL.md`](./skills/nemotron-customize/SKILL.md) for the full contract.

> The marketplace installs **only** `nemotron-customize`. The other folders under [`skills/`](./skills/) (model knowledge bases, contributor add-`*` skills) stay on disk for repo browsing but are not loaded as plugins.

## What is Nemotron?

[NVIDIA Nemotron](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/foundation-models/nemotron/) is a family of open, high-efficiency multimodal models purpose-built for agentic AI.

**Model Tiers:**

- **Nano** — Optimized for edge and PC deployments
- **Lightning** — Fast, high-volume task execution for long-running agents
- **Super** — Single GPU deployment with highest throughput
- **Ultra** — Multi-GPU datacenter applications

Nemotron models excel at coding, math, scientific reasoning, tool calling, instruction following, and visual reasoning. Deploy across edge, single GPU, or data center environments with support for NeMo, TensorRT-LLM, vLLM, SGLang, and NIM microservices.

---

## Nemotron Steps

A *Nemotron step* is a named, reusable unit of work that you invoke with the `nemotron steps` CLI.
Each step packages a description of the work it performs, the artifacts it consumes and produces, and one or more named configurations that supply parameter values.
Steps live under [`src/nemotron/steps/`](./src/nemotron/steps/), and the CLI discovers them at startup.

The training recipes in the next section are composed from these steps.
Run a step on its own when you want one stage, or chain steps together when you need a different pipeline shape than the published recipes.

### Step Categories

The catalog covers the full training lifecycle.

- Data curation and preparation with `curate/*` and `data_prep/*`.
- Synthetic data generation (SDG) with `sdg/*`.
- Corpus translation with `translate/*`.
- Bring-your-own benchmark generation with `byob/*`.
- Pretraining, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and reinforcement learning (RL) with `pretrain/*`, `sft/*`, `peft/*`, and `rl/*`.
- Checkpoint conversion and model optimization with `convert/*` and `optimize/*`.
- Benchmark evaluation with `eval/*`.
- Execution-profile setup with `env/*`.

### Documentation

- [About Nemotron Steps](docs/steps/index.md) is the entry point for the step model.
- [Nemotron Steps Basics](docs/steps/basics.md) defines *step*, *configuration*, *environment profile*, and *artifact*.
- [Getting Started With Steps](docs/steps/getting-started.md) walks through the CLI on a small example.

## Training Recipes

The Nemotron repository provides reproducible training pipelines from raw data to deployment-ready models. These implementations reflect how large language models are actually trained: careful experimentation, validation gates, and systematic optimization.

### Why Complete Pipelines?

Training a production model involves interconnected components. Isolated examples miss how stages interact. Complete pipelines show:

- **How data quality affects downstream performance** across pretraining, SFT, and RL
- **Which training techniques actually work together**, not just in theory
- **Where validation gates prevent failures** and maintain reproducibility
- **How to balance competing objectives** across stages

Because these are complete systems, you can extract specific techniques with confidence. Each component has been proven to work in context.

### Each Recipe Includes

- 🎨 **Synthetic Data Generation** - Scripts to generate synthetic datasets using [NVIDIA-NeMo/DataDesigner](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/DataDesigner)
- 🗂️ **Data Curation** - Scripts to prepare training data using [NVIDIA NeMo Curator](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Curator) for scalable data processing, filtering, and quality enhancement
- 🔁 **Training** - Complete training loops with hyperparameters using:
  - [NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge/tree/main) for Megatron models
  - [NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel) for HuggingFace models
  - [NVIDIA-NeMo/NeMo-RL](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL/tree/main) when RL is needed
  - Includes GPU-accelerated last-mile data processing (tokenization + optional sequence packing) for optimal training efficiency
- 📊 **Evaluation** - Benchmark evaluation on standard suites using [NVIDIA NeMo Evaluator](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Evaluator)
- 📖 **Documentation** - Detailed explanations of each stage
