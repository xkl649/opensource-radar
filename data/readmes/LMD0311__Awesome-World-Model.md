## Workshop & Challenge

- [`CVPR 25 Workshop & Challenge | OpenDriveLab`](https://opendrivelab.com/challenge25/#1x-wm) Track: World Model.
> A world model is a computer program that can imagine how the world evolves in response to an agent's behavior. It has the potential to solve general-purpose simulation and evaluation, enabling robots that are safe, reliable, and intelligent in a wide variety of scenarios.
- [`World Model Bench @ CVPR'25`](https://worldmodelbench.github.io/) WorldModelBench: The 1st Workshop on Benchmarking World Models
> World models refer to predictive models of physical phenomena in the world surrounding us. These models are fundamental for Physical AI agents, enabling crucial capabilities such as decision-making, planning, and counterfactual analysis. Effective world models must integrate several key components, including perception, instruction following, controllability, physical plausibility, and future prediction.
- [`CVPR 24 Workshop & Challenge | OpenDriveLab`](https://opendrivelab.com/challenge24/#predictive_world_model) Track #4: Predictive World Model.
- [`CVPR 23 Workshop on Autonomous Driving`](https://cvpr23.wad.vision/) CHALLENGE 3: ARGOVERSE CHALLENGES, [3D Occupancy Forecasting](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/1977/overview) using the [Argoverse 2 Sensor Dataset](https://www.argoverse.org/av2.html#sensor-link). Predict the spacetime occupancy of the world for the next 3 seconds.

  > World models are the basis for the ability to predict what might happen next, which is fundamentally important for autonomous driving. They can act as a learned simulator, or a mental “what if” thought experiment for model-based reinforcement learning (RL) or planning. By incorporating world models into our driving models, we can enable them to understand human decisions better and ultimately generalise to more real-world situations.
