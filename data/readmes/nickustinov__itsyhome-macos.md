## Itsyhome Pro

### Cameras

View all your cameras at once in a live grid, right in the menu bar. Every HomeKit camera streams simultaneously; arrange them in 1-3 columns, mark cameras as full-width tiles, and resize the panel by dragging a corner - it stays anchored under the menu bar icon and remembers your size. Clicking a tile opens the camera full-panel with zoom, audio and push-to-talk, claiming the already-running stream so there is no renegotiation delay. Home Assistant cameras show snapshot tiles with tap-to-stream over WebRTC or HLS. Overlay action buttons let you control nearby accessories without leaving the camera view - toggle lights and outlets, open garage doors and gates, or lock and unlock doors.

### Doorbell notifications

When a doorbell rings, the camera panel automatically opens in the top-right corner of the screen with a pinned live stream of the doorbell camera. Supports HomeKit doorbells and Home Assistant doorbell events. A configurable chime sound plays on ring. Both the automatic camera display and the sound can be independently toggled in Settings → Cameras.

### Virtual HomeKit sensors & automations

Itsyhome can publish its own bridge to Apple Home over HAP, carrying read-only virtual sensors (contact, motion, occupancy, leak, smoke, CO, CO2). Manage them in Settings → HomeKit bridge and pair by scanning a QR code (or typing the setup code); pairings and the bridge identity persist across restarts, with the identity key stored in the Keychain. Sensor state is set by name through the regular webhook verbs, or by built-in automations: "WHEN a HomeKit accessory holds a state FOR a duration THEN set a virtual sensor", with optional re-pulsing - so Apple Home can automate on conditions HomeKit can't compute itself, like "door open for 15 minutes". HomeKit mode only.

### Sensor history

Opt-in 30-day history for every sensor, shown as a chart in the sensor's submenu: a line for temperature and humidity (thermostat and AC current temperature included), an on/off timeline for binary sensors, with hover readout and a 24h/7d/30d range toggle. Captured off the existing update path - no extra polling - and stored locally per home. Periods when nothing was recording (app closed, Mac asleep) show as gaps in the chart. Enable it in Settings → Advanced.

### iCloud sync

Sync your favourites, hidden items, device groups, shortcuts, and pinned items across all your Macs.

### Deeplinks

Control your smart home devices from external apps using URL schemes. Perfect for Shortcuts, Alfred, Raycast, Stream Deck, and other automation tools. Works with both HomeKit and Home Assistant.

**URL format:**
```
itsyhome://<action>/<target>
```

open "itsyhome://toggle/group.Office%20Lights"
open "itsyhome://scene/Goodnight"
open "itsyhome://brightness/50/Bedroom/Lamp"
```

**Note:** Spaces in room or device names must be URL-encoded as `%20`.

### Webhooks/CLI

A built-in HTTP server that lets you control and query your smart home devices from any tool on your network — terminal, scripts, other apps, or the dedicated [itsyhome CLI](https://github.com/nickustinov/itsyhome-cli). Works with both HomeKit and Home Assistant.

Enable the server in Settings → Webhooks/CLI. Default port: `8423`. The server can optionally be bound to a single interface address (e.g. a Tailscale mesh IP) so it's reachable over a private network only.

**Control endpoints:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8423/toggle/Office/Spotlights
curl http://localhost:8423/on/Kitchen/Light
curl http://localhost:8423/off/Bedroom/Lamp
curl http://localhost:8423/brightness/50/Office/Lamp
curl http://localhost:8423/position/75/Living%20Room/Blinds
curl http://localhost:8423/speed/50/Bedroom/Ceiling%20Fan
curl http://localhost:8423/temp/22/Hallway/Thermostat
curl http://localhost:8423/heat/19/Hallway/Thermostat        # heating threshold (auto-mode)
curl http://localhost:8423/cool/23/Hallway/Thermostat        # cooling threshold (auto-mode)
curl http://localhost:8423/mode/auto/Hallway/Thermostat      # off | heat | cool | auto | heat_cool | dry | fan_only
curl http://localhost:8423/color/120/100/Bedroom/Light
curl http://localhost:8423/scene/Goodnight                   # activate scene
curl http://localhost:8423/off/scene/Goodnight               # deactivate scene (Apple Home semantics)
curl http://localhost:8423/lock/Front%20Door
curl http://localhost:8423/unlock/Front%20Door
curl http://localhost:8423/open/Garage/Door
curl http://localhost:8423/close/Bedroom/Blinds
curl http://localhost:8423/arm/stay/Hall/Alarm
curl http://localhost:8423/arm/away/Hall/Alarm
curl http://localhost:8423/arm/night/Hall/Alarm
curl http://localhost:8423/disarm/Hall/Alarm
curl http://localhost:8423/refresh
```

**Query endpoints:**

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/status` | Home summary (rooms, devices, reachable/unreachable counts) |
| `/list/rooms` | List all rooms, with the Phosphor icon used in the menubar |
| `/list/devices` | List all devices with type and reachability |
| `/list/devices/<room>` | List devices in a specific room |
| `/list/scenes` | List all scenes. Items include `state: { on }` when the scene's "active" state can be computed (HomeKit scenes with a granular action list); omitted otherwise so clients fall back to fire-only |
| `/list/groups` | List all device groups (includes room info for room-scoped groups) |
| `/list/groups/<room>` | List groups available in a specific room (room-scoped + global) |
| `/list/favourites` | List items pinned as favourites (services, device groups, scenes, rooms). Alias: `/list/favorites` |
| `/info/<target>` | Detailed device/room info with current state. Battery-powered accessories include `battery` (0-100) and `batteryLow`. For scenes, includes `state: { on }` matching `/list/scenes` |
| `/icon/<name>` | PNG of a Phosphor icon. Query params: `?fill=1` for filled variant, `?size=64` for size in pixels |
| `/events` | SSE event stream for real-time characteristic changes |

List responses respect the user's drag ordering from Settings → Accessories, and hidden items are filtered out (a specific `/info/<name>` lookup still works for hidden items).

**Event stream (SSE):**

Stream real-time device state changes using [Server-Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events). Connect with `curl -N` or any SSE client (including `EventSource` in browsers). Only actual value changes are emitted — read refreshes are filtered out.

```bash
curl -N http://localhost:8423/events
```

Each event is a JSON object on a `data:` line:

```
data: {"characteristic":"brightness","characteristicId":"ABC-123","device":"Desk Lamp","entityId":"light.desk_lamp","room":"Office","serviceId":"DEF-456","timestamp":"2026-02-09T14:30:00Z","type":"light","value":75}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `device` | Human-readable device name |
| `room` | Room the device belongs to |
| `type` | Device type (`light`, `switch`, `thermostat`, `blinds`, etc.) |
| `characteristic` | Characteristic that changed (`power`, `brightness`, `current-temperature`, etc.) |
| `value` | New value (type varies: boolean, integer, double) |
| `characteristicId` | UUID of the characteristic |
| `serviceId` | UUID of the service |
| `entityId` | Home Assistant entity ID (only present for HA devices) |
| `timestamp` | ISO 8601 timestamp |

Multiple clients can connect simultaneously. A `: heartbeat` comment is sent every 15 seconds to keep connections alive.

**Response format:**

```json
{"status": "success"}
{"status": "error", "message": "device not found"}
```

**CLI tool:**

Install the dedicated CLI for a better terminal experience:

```bash
brew install nickustinov/tap/itsyhome
```

See [itsyhome-cli](https://github.com/nickustinov/itsyhome-cli) for full documentation.

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0 or later
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) for project generation
- Apple Developer account with HomeKit entitlement (for HomeKit mode)
- Home Assistant server with long-lived access token (for Home Assistant mode)

## How it works

**HomeKit mode:**
1. The Catalyst app initializes HomeKit and monitors for device updates
2. Device data is serialized to JSON and passed to the macOS plugin
3. The plugin renders custom `NSMenuItem` views with controls
4. User interactions are sent back to the Catalyst app to execute HomeKit commands

**Home Assistant mode:**
1. The macOS plugin connects directly to Home Assistant via WebSocket
2. Entity states are fetched and mapped to the common `MenuData` format
3. Real-time state changes are received via WebSocket subscriptions
4. User interactions call Home Assistant services directly via the REST API

## Debugging

Startup diagnostics logging can be enabled by setting `StartupLogger.enabled = true` in `macOSBridge/Utilities/StartupLogger.swift`. Logs are emitted via `os_log` with subsystem `com.nickustinov.itsyhome` and category `Startup`, viewable in Console.app or via:

```bash
log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "com.nickustinov.itsyhome"' --level info
```

**Home Assistant debugging:**

For local testing without real hardware, run the Home Assistant demo:

```bash
docker run -d --name homeassistant -p 8123:8123 ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:stable
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8123`, create an account, and generate a long-lived access token.

### Webhook debug endpoints

When the webhook server is running, these debug endpoints are available:

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /debug/<name>` | Returns characteristics, service type, limits, room, and reachability for a specific device or service matched by name |
| `GET /debug/all` | Dumps all accessories with their services, rooms count, and scenes count |
| `GET /debug/raw` | Returns the complete raw HomeKit data dump from the iOS bridge including service groups, zones, action sets, and triggers |
| `GET /debug/cameras` | Probes all camera entities – snapshot, HLS, and WebRTC connectivity tests with timing. Tokens are redacted. |
| `GET /debug/cameras/<entity_id>` | Same as above for a single camera (e.g. `camera.front_door`) |

Example using curl:

```bash
curl http://localhost:<port>/debug/all
curl http://localhost:<port>/debug/Living%20Room%20Light
curl http://localhost:<port>/debug/raw
curl http://localhost:<port>/debug/cameras
curl http://localhost:<port>/debug/cameras/camera.front_door
```
