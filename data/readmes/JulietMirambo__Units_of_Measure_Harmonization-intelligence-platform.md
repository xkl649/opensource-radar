**Manufacturing and procurement organizations lose millions annually** due to Unit of Measure (UOM) errors.

A single misplaced decimal or wrong unit causes:
- Order fulfillment disasters (50kg vs 50lbs)
- Inventory chaos (overstocking/understocking)
- Supply chain disruptions (wrong quantities shipped)
- Financial losses (incorrect billing, waste)
- Compliance issues (regulatory violations)

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Import your data** (CSV/Excel with UOM column)
2. **Execute the workflow** (one-click execution)
3. **View results** in the interactive dashboard
4. **Export corrections** to apply to your system

### Example Results

```
Input:  "50 KG" (should be "50 EA")
Output: Detected | Corrected | Confidence: 94%

Processing: 10,000 records
Time: 3 minutes
Errors Found: 847 (8.47%)
Auto-Corrected: 796 (94%)
Manual Review: 51 (6%)
```

### Supported Formats

- CSV files (UTF-8, any delimiter)
- Excel files (.xlsx, .xls)
- Tab-separated values
- Pipe-delimited files

### Error Types Detected

- **Decimal Errors** - 50.0 vs 50 EA
- **Unit Mismatches** - KG vs EA, LBS vs KG
- **Conversion Issues** - Imperial/Metric confusion
- **Format Problems** - Spacing, capitalization
- **Missing Units** - Blank or null UOM fields
