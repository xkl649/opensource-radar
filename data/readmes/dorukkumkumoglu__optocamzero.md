# Optocam Zero

Optocam Zero is a Raspberry Pi Zero based compact digital camera made using off the shelf components. 

I designed Optocam Zero to have a very compact, carry everywhere and have fun sort of camera. As I was inspired by Kodak charmera and similar toy cameras, I wanted it to be feel playful, enjoyable and be intuitive to use. I also aimed to make it relatively easy to build so that others can also build one and have fun with it. That's why all the case parts are easily printable and for the electronics it uses off the shelf components that are easy to find.

## How to Build Optocam Zero?

Everything you need to build an Optocam Zero yourself is included in this repo.

All the 3d print files, Required parts list, and detailed step by step build guide can be found under the [hardware](hardware/) folder.

If you're considering building one, check the [BOM](hardware/BOM.md) to get an idea of the cost for required tools and parts.
Also, have a look at the [build guide](hardware/optocamzero-build-guide.pdf), it will give you a clear idea of what the build involves.
