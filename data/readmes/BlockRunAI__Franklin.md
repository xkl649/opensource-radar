## The pitch in one paragraph

Franklin Agent is an **autonomous economic agent** — an AI that holds a USDC wallet and spends it to get real work done, with **trading as its flagship arena**. It buys live market data, proposes trade plans you approve before a cent moves, pursues long-running goals across sessions, keeps a wallet-bound trading journal, and picks the best model per task from 55+ providers. You state an outcome and set a budget. Franklin Agent decides what to call, what to pay for, and when to stop. Every paid action routes through the [x402](https://x402.org) micropayment protocol and settles against your own wallet. No subscriptions. No API keys. No account. The wallet is the identity.

Built by the [BlockRun](https://blockrun.ai) team. Apache-2.0. TypeScript. Ships as one npm package.

> **YOPO — You Only Pay Outcome**
>
> Not a subscription (pay for access). Not a generic pay-per-call (pay for trying).
> You pay only for the work Franklin Agent delivers. Provider cost + 5%, settled per action
> in USDC. No monthly fees. No rate limits. No overdraft.

---

## Quick start

> **Requires Node.js 20.19+ (Node 22 LTS recommended).** Check with `node -v`. Older Node crashes at startup with `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM`.

```bash
# 1. Install
npm install -g @blockrun/franklin

# 2. Run (free — uses NVIDIA Nemotron & Qwen3 Coder out of the box)
franklin

# 3. (optional) Fund a wallet to unlock Sonnet, Opus, GPT, Gemini, Grok, + paid APIs
franklin setup base        # or: franklin setup solana
franklin balance           # show address + USDC balance
```

That's it. Zero signup, zero credit card, zero phone verification. Send **$5 of USDC** to the wallet and you've unlocked every frontier model and every paid tool in the BlockRun gateway.

**No global install? Just run it directly** — no permissions, no `-g`:

```bash
npx @blockrun/franklin
```

### Install troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| ------- | ----- | --- |
| `npm error EACCES … mkdir '/usr/local/lib/node_modules'` | Your global npm folder is owned by root (common when Node was installed from the macOS `.pkg`). | Don't use `sudo`. Either run `npx @blockrun/franklin` (no global install needed), or switch to a user-owned Node via a version manager — see below. |
| `Error [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM] … rpc-websockets … require() of ES Module … uuid` | Node is older than 20.19. Franklin's Solana deps need the `require(esm)` support added in Node 20.19.0. | Upgrade to Node 20.19+ or 22 LTS (see below). This is the #1 cause of a crash on first run. |
| `npm warn EBADENGINE … required: { node: '>=20.x' }` | Node is older than 20.19. | Upgrade to Node 20.19+ or 22 LTS. The warning alone is harmless, but on old Node the run will also crash — upgrade. |

The clean, permanent fix for both is a **user-owned Node** so global installs never touch root-owned system folders:

```bash
# nvm (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
nvm install 22 && nvm use 22
npm install -g @blockrun/franklin

# or fnm (https://github.com/Schniz/fnm)
fnm install 22 && fnm use 22
npm install -g @blockrun/franklin
```

### Prefer a GUI? Try Franklin for VS Code

[![Franklin for VS Code — Beta is here](assets/franklin-vscode-banner.png)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=blockrun.franklin-vscode)

The same agent ships as a [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=blockrun.franklin-vscode) — chat panel, model picker, wallet balance, image / video generation, inline diff cards — all driven by the wallet you already funded for the CLI.

```
VS Code → Extensions  (Cmd+Shift+X / Ctrl+Shift+X)
        → search "Franklin" → Install
        → click the Franklin icon in the Activity Bar
```

Free models work immediately. Paid models, image gen, and video gen activate the moment your wallet has USDC. The CLI and the extension share the same `~/.blockrun/` config and session history, so jumping between terminal and VS Code is seamless.

---

## YOPO

**You Only Pay Outcome.** This is Franklin Agent's pricing model, and it is the opposite of almost every other AI product you use.

|                         | You pay for...                               | Result                               |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| AI subscription       | Access. Paid whether you use it or not. | $20–200/month, rate-limited.         |
| Pay-per-call (OpenAI API, etc.) | Every attempt — even failed ones.    | Hidden cost from retries, dead ends. |
| **Franklin Agent (YOPO)**     | **The outcome.** Each signed micropayment.  | **Provider cost + 5%. No more.**     |

Three consequences fall out of this:

1. **No subscriptions.** Use Franklin for $0.50 one week and $50 the next — you pay for compute actually consumed, nothing more.
2. **No rate limits.** Subscriptions throttle you when you need AI most. YOPO has no artificial caps — if you have USDC, you have access.
3. **No overdraft.** The wallet balance IS the hard limit. When it's empty, Franklin stops. No surprise bills, no 3 a.m. rate-limit walls.

Concretely — $1 in USDC gets you roughly:
- ~400K GPT-4o input tokens
- ~7M DeepSeek tokens
- ~13M Gemini Flash tokens
- ~20 DALL-E 3 images
- ~40 Exa neural web searches
- Unlimited agent-tested NVIDIA free tier (Qwen3 Coder + Llama 4 Maverick, no wallet needed)

---

## A new category

> **Economic Agent**
>
> Software that can hold a wallet, price its own actions, spend toward an outcome, and stop at a hard budget cap.

Most AI products fit into one of three buckets: they answer questions, write code, or automate a fixed workflow. None of them can spend money.

Franklin can. It combines **purchasing power** (it pays for models, tools, and APIs), **budget awareness** (cost is part of the loop, not an afterthought), **cross-vertical execution** (code, trading, research, marketing, ops), and **hard stopping conditions** (wallet balance is a real constraint, not a suggestion).

That is why Franklin is an economic agent, not just a task agent.

---

## What Franklin can execute

Franklin is **chat-first**. You do not wire a DAG, configure six API keys, or commit to one model vendor. You state an outcome. Franklin decides what to read, search, fetch, call, and pay for.

### 📈 Trading signals

```text
> what's BTC looking like today?

  ✓ TradingSignal  BTC

  ## BTC Signal Report

  Price: $71,056 USD (+2.3% 24h)
  Market Cap: $1.42T
  24h Volume: $29.6B

  ### Technical Indicators (30d)
  - RSI(14): 53.2 — neutral
  - MACD: 339.21 / Signal: 280.45 — bullish crossover
  - Bollinger: within band (upper $73,773 / lower $64,545)
  - Volatility: 35.3% annualized — medium

  Risk/reward to $70K target: 1:2.8 ✓
```

Live data from CoinGecko. RSI, MACD, Bollinger, and volatility computed locally. No API key needed.

### 🛡️ Trades only move on YOUR approval

Real-money trades (Jupiter, 0x, Polymarket) are hard-gated behind a **trade plan**: the agent proposes a structured plan — venue, asset, size, slippage, stop condition, rationale, total spend — and nothing executes until you approve it. Approved budgets draw down per trade and expire in 15 minutes. This holds in every permission mode, `--trust` included. Add your own guardrails as [lifecycle hooks](docs/examples/hooks/) — daily spend caps, token blacklists, spend ledgers — that veto actions before money moves.

### 🎯 Autonomous goals with adversarial verification

```text
> /goal research the top 3 x402-compatible data APIs and produce a comparison
```

Franklin plans the objective, works it across turns on its own, and — when it claims completion — a panel of **adversarial reviewers audits the evidence and refutes anything unsupported**. Bounded by a turn cap, a verification-round cap, and your `--max-spend`. Esc pauses at any time. Pair with `/loop 1h check funding rates` (durable scheduler) and the `Monitor` tool (live feeds delivered at turn boundaries) for always-on market coverage.

### 🧠 A memory that follows your wallet

Every trade journals itself: thesis on open, P&L on close, written to a **wallet-keyed trading journal** (`~/.blockrun/memory/trading-*/`) that any session can recall — "what was my SOL thesis?" just works, from any directory. Session learnings capture with `/flush`, consolidate with `/dream`, and inject automatically at session start.

### 🕹️ Mission control for your fleet

`franklin serve` + `franklin panel` → the **Agents** tab: dispatch one agent per strategy or market, watch them stream live, reply to any of them, and approve their trade plans and permission requests — all from one browser page. Sessions started in a terminal show up too.

### 🎨 Image generation

```text
> generate a logo for my AI startup — minimalist, dark background

  ✓ ImageGen  "minimalist AI startup logo, dark background..."
  Saved: generated-logo-1713052800.png (1024x1024)
```

Generates images via DALL-E / GPT Image directly from the CLI. Paid from your wallet — no OpenAI API key needed.

### 📱 Remote control via Telegram

Run `franklin telegram` on an always-on machine (set `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` + `TELEGRAM_OWNER_ID`) and drive Franklin from your phone. Owner-locked, session-resumable across restarts, slash commands (`/new`, `/balance`, `/status`). Trading, content, dev work — all reachable from a Telegram chat.

### 🔎 Research, code, anything with a budget

```text
> compare the top 5 AI agent pricing models, summarize the patterns, and save a note for me

  ✓ WebSearch  ai agent pricing models
  ✓ WebFetch   5 articles
  ✓ Write      notes/agent-pricing.md

  Summary:
  - Most agents hide pricing behind monthly seats
  - Usage-based products win with power users and teams
  - Wallet-based billing is still basically empty whitespace
```

```text
> refactor src/auth.ts to use the new jwt helper, then run the tests

  ✓ Read   src/auth.ts                    $0.002
  ✓ Read   src/lib/jwt.ts                 $0.001
  ✓ Edit   src/auth.ts (-24 +31 lines)    $0.008
  ✓ Bash   npm test                       $0.000
    › 142 passing · 0 failing · 2.4s

  Done in 18s · $0.011
```

Code is still first-class. It is just **one workload**, not the category.

Every tool call is itemized. Every token is priced. When the wallet hits zero, Franklin stops. No overdraft, no surprise bill, no rate-limit wall at 3 a.m. — this is YOPO in practice.

---

## Smart Router

**<!-- br:models.chatVisible -->71<!-- /br:models.chatVisible --> models. One decision. Zero guesswork.**

You don't pick models. Franklin picks for you.

The Smart Router classifies every request — coding, trading, reasoning, research — and selects the model with the best quality-to-cost ratio. Trained on **2M+ real requests** from the BlockRun gateway, continuously updated.

```text
> refactor this auth module to use JWT

  CODING kimi-k2.5  ·  12.4K in / 2.1K out  ·  $0.0023  saved 84%

> what's the BTC outlook for the week?

  TRADING grok-4-1-fast-reasoning  ·  8.2K in / 1.8K out  ·  $0.0008  saved 95%

> prove that this algorithm is O(n log n)

  REASONING claude-sonnet-4.6  ·  15.1K in / 3.4K out  ·  $0.0312
```

Every response shows which model was chosen, why, and how much you saved vs. always using the most expensive option.

**Four profiles:**

| Profile | Strategy | Use case |
|---------|----------|----------|
| `auto` | Best quality-to-cost ratio | Default — smart spend |
| `eco` | Cheapest model with decent quality | Budget-conscious |
| `premium` | Highest quality regardless of cost | Mission-critical |
| `free` | Free NVIDIA models only | Zero wallet balance |

**Per-session breakdown** — run `/cost` to see exactly where your USDC went:

```text
Session Cost: $0.0847 (23 requests)
  gemini-2.5-flash       $0.0012   14 req   CODING
  kimi-k2.5              $0.0423    6 req   CODING
  claude-sonnet-4.6      $0.0412    3 req   REASONING
```

The router also learns from **your** usage. If you keep retrying a model for coding tasks, Franklin adapts and picks a better one next time. Your router gets smarter the more you use it.

## Why Franklin

<table>
<tr>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### 💳 &nbsp;AI is utility, not SaaS

You don't subscribe to electricity, you pay for what you use. Franklin brings the same model to AI. YOPO settlement means Franklin never bills you for access, only for outcomes. No monthly fees, no rate limits, no overdraft.

</td>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### 🧠 &nbsp;Multi-model is the future

No single model is best at everything. Sonnet writes better code, Gemini handles longer context, DeepSeek costs 20x less for simple tasks. The Smart Router routes every request to the optimal model in <1ms — <!-- br:savings.autoVsBaselinePct -->88<!-- /br:savings.autoVsBaselinePct -->% cheaper than pinning Claude Opus 5 for every request.

</td>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### 🔐 &nbsp;Wallet is identity

No email. No phone. No KYC. Your Base or Solana address is your account — portable, permissionless, global. API keys require US banking and account approval. A wallet requires only USDC.

```

The loop is simple:
1. You state an outcome.
2. Franklin chooses what to read, call, and pay for.
3. The payment settles against your wallet.
4. Franklin reports the result and the spend.

That economic loop is the product.

## Free tier, for real

Start with **zero dollars**. Franklin defaults to free NVIDIA models that need no wallet funding.

```bash
franklin --model free
```

When you fund the wallet, Franklin gets more purchasing power: Sonnet, Opus, GPT, Gemini, Grok, and paid tools like Exa, DALL-E, and CoinGecko Pro.

## Remote control via Telegram

Drive Franklin from anywhere with a bot token:

```bash
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<from @BotFather>
export TELEGRAM_OWNER_ID=<your numeric Telegram user id>
franklin telegram                # start the bot (owner-locked)
```

Session state resumes across process restarts (tagged by owner id).
Slash commands `/new`, `/balance`, `/status`, `/help` handled locally
by the bot layer; everything else forwards to the agent. Progressive
streaming flushes partial answers at paragraph boundaries so long
replies don't wait for turn-end.

Same wallet. Same tools. From your phone.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BlockRunAI/Franklin.git
cd franklin
npm install
npm run build
npm test              # deterministic local tests — no API calls
npm run test:e2e      # live e2e tests — free smoke works unfunded; paid tools need network + funded wallet
npm run test:free-models # live matrix across current free NVIDIA models
node dist/index.js --help
```

For the recommended live validation order and failure triage, see [docs/live-e2e-checklist.md](docs/live-e2e-checklist.md).
