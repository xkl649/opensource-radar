## Requirements

- Node.js 22.6+ (`nvm use` will pick up the repo's `.nvmrc`, which matches CI)
- npm 10+ or another supported package manager
- Docker Desktop is recommended for sandbox browser execution
- Optional provider CLIs if you want delegated CLI backends such as Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini, Copilot, Factory Droid, Cursor Agent, Qwen Code, or Goose

## Quick Start

### Desktop app (recommended for non-technical users)

Download the one-click installer from [swarmclaw.ai/downloads](https://swarmclaw.ai/downloads).
Available for macOS (Apple Silicon & Intel), Windows, and Linux (AppImage + .deb).

The release workflow supports Developer ID signing and notarization when Apple
credentials are configured. If a macOS build is still ad-hoc signed, first
launch may need one manual approval:
- **macOS:** signed/notarized releases publish both `.dmg` and `.zip`; unsigned fallback releases publish `.zip` only to avoid the damaged unsigned DMG path. Right-click the app in Finder → **Open** → **Open** to bypass Gatekeeper. If macOS instead reports *"SwarmClaw is damaged and can't be opened"* (common when a downloaded app was quarantined by Safari), strip the quarantine attribute and relaunch:
  ```bash
  xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/SwarmClaw.app
  ```
- **Windows:** if SmartScreen appears, click **More info** → **Run anyway**.
- **Linux (AppImage):** `chmod +x` the downloaded file, then run it.

Data lives in your OS app-data directory (`~/Library/Application Support/SwarmClaw`,
`%APPDATA%\SwarmClaw`, or `~/.config/SwarmClaw`), separate from any CLI or Docker install.

### Global install

```bash
npm i -g @swarmclawai/swarmclaw
swarmclaw
```

```bash
yarn global add @swarmclawai/swarmclaw
swarmclaw
```

```bash
pnpm add -g @swarmclawai/swarmclaw
swarmclaw
```

```bash
bun add -g @swarmclawai/swarmclaw
swarmclaw
```

Running `swarmclaw` starts the server on `http://localhost:3456`.

### From the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/swarmclawai/swarmclaw.git
cd swarmclaw
nvm use
npm run quickstart
```

`npm run quickstart` installs dependencies, prepares local config and runtime state, and starts SwarmClaw.

### Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/swarmclawai/swarmclaw.git
cd swarmclaw
mkdir -p data
touch .env.local
docker compose up -d --build
```

Then open `http://localhost:3456`.

## ClawHub Skill

Install the SwarmClaw skill for your [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) agents:

```bash
openclaw skills install swarmclaw
```

## v1.9.39 Highlights

Scheduled-run reliability release: stale workspace rebinding, fail-fast credential checks, and durable delivery evidence for schedule-driven sends.

- **Legacy workspace cwd migration.** Scheduled reruns and reused schedule sessions pinned to a pre-migration workspace root (e.g. `~/.swarmclaw/workspace`) are now rebound to the current `WORKSPACE_DIR` automatically; intentional custom working directories are never touched.
- **Orphan recovery dedup.** Startup queue recovery now recovers each orphaned task once instead of re-logging it every tick, and dead-letters tasks that repeatedly return to the queue without starting.
- **Schedule delivery status.** Every scheduled run now writes `lastDeliveryStatus`/`lastDeliveryError` back to its schedule, so failures are visible without digging through task records.
- **Credential preflight for schedules.** Scheduled runs on API-key providers fail fast with an actionable error when no credential resolves, instead of dying on a 401 deep in execution.
- **Empty-run classification.** Runs that produce no text, no tool calls, and no error now fail with a clear provider-configuration message instead of a generic validation failure.
- **Durable connector delivery evidence.** Task follow-up sends route through the connector outbox with task/schedule linkage, retries with backoff, and per-run dedupe, so triage can prove whether a scheduled send succeeded, failed, or was never attempted.
- **Regression coverage.** Added tests for workspace path normalization, orphan recovery, schedule outcome writes, credential preflight, empty-run classification, and outbox-backed follow-ups.

## v1.9.38 Highlights

PR integration release for provider catalog coverage, OpenRouter context meters, and safer unsigned macOS desktop artifacts.

- **TokenMix provider.** Added TokenMix as a built-in OpenAI-compatible provider with setup metadata, starter-agent defaults, and provider health checks.
- **OpenRouter context meters.** Chat context status now uses cached OpenRouter model metadata when available so routed model context windows display accurately.
- **macOS unsigned artifact fallback.** Desktop releases publish zip-only macOS artifacts when signing/notarization inputs are missing, avoiding the unsigned DMG damaged-app path.
- **Regression coverage.** Added targeted tests for TokenMix setup, OpenRouter context metadata caching, and macOS target selection.

## v1.9.37 Highlights

Theme and memory-pressure release for lighter UI preferences and leaner chat history storage.

- **Light, dark, and system theme modes.** Settings → Appearance now persists a Light/Dark/System selector while keeping the existing hue presets and custom color picker.
- **Lean session history storage.** Legacy transcript blobs migrate into the `session_messages` table and are compacted from session records after persistence is verified, reducing page-load memory pressure on lower-RAM devices.
- **Repo-backed message readers.** Global search, live usage summaries, and OpenClaw history merge now read table-backed messages after transcript compaction.
- **Regression coverage.** Added tests for theme-mode normalization, legacy transcript compaction, and repo-backed message search.

## v1.9.36 Highlights

Protocol builder visibility release for built-in Structured Sessions.

- **Built-in flow inspector.** Built-in protocol templates now open in a full-size visual builder canvas with a read-only template step panel.
- **Canvas viewport repair.** Builder routes now claim the full dashboard workspace and refit React Flow after async template loads.
- **Regression coverage.** Browser smoke now verifies that the built-in facilitated discussion graph renders with visible flow nodes.

## v1.9.35 Highlights

Installed package build fix for fresh npm-global installs and upgrades.

- **Fallback build dependency fix.** The npm package now declares `mime-types` and `@types/mime-types` directly so `swarmclaw server --build` can type-check the OpenClaw media proxy on clean installs.
- **Installed-build regression guard.** CLI/package tests now verify that unbundled type declarations needed by local fallback builds ship as runtime package dependencies.
- **macOS desktop status.** The damaged-app issue remains open until Developer ID signing and Apple notarization are configured and verified on downloaded macOS artifacts.

## v1.9.34 Highlights

Credential recovery and external extension access release for npm-global upgrades and scoped agent tool configuration.

- **Credential secret recovery.** Startup now checks prior npm-global build env files before accepting a fresh per-version `CREDENTIAL_SECRET`, and validates candidate secrets against existing encrypted credentials before persisting `DATA_DIR/credential-secret`.
- **Clear connector failures.** Connector startup now logs and surfaces credential decrypt failures directly instead of falling through to a misleading "No bot token configured" error.
- **External extension tools.** Scoped agents now keep explicitly attached external `*.js` and `*.mjs` extensions, and the agent/chat tool controls persist enabled external tools through the `extensions` field.
- **Regression coverage.** Added tests for previous-build credential recovery, non-decrypting secret replacement, scoped external extension access, and extension access persistence.

## v1.9.33 Highlights

Issue and PR validation release for credential durability, delegated task dispatch, connector output hygiene, and OpenClaw gateway protocol compatibility.

- **Credential durability.** Execute-tool credential injection now reads the persisted `encryptedKey` field, and `CREDENTIAL_SECRET` now resolves in a stable order: explicit environment value, `DATA_DIR/credential-secret`, legacy env files, then generated fallback.
- **Delegated task dispatch.** Agent-created tasks delegated to another agent auto-queue when no explicit status is supplied, and failed dead-lettered tasks can be requeued through `POST /api/tasks/:id/retry`.
- **Connector output hygiene.** Connector replies now reuse the internal metadata scrubber before delivery and persistence, while successful non-connector delivery tool output is no longer overwritten as an unconfirmed send.
- **Agent and gateway compatibility.** Agent updates preserve workspace filesystem settings, and OpenClaw gateway routes now use protocol version 4.
- **Regression coverage.** Added tests for credential env injection, secret precedence, delegated queueing, failed-task retry, connector sanitization, agent workspace settings, and OpenClaw gateway protocol exports.

## v1.9.32 Highlights

PR integration release for background model routing, reflection memory controls, and current ClawHub install guidance.

- **Background model routing.** Per-agent `dreamConfig` overrides can route dream cycles and daily digests before global dream settings, while `compactionProvider` settings can route live auto-compaction summaries through a cheaper or faster model.
- **Reflection memory controls.** `reflectionMinQuality` gates automatic reflection memory writes without dropping the reflection record, and optional embedding dedup skips near-duplicate reflection notes when embeddings are configured.
- **ClawHub install guidance.** OpenClaw skill docs now use `openclaw skills install swarmclaw` and current owner-scoped ClawHub links.
- **Regression coverage.** Added tests for dream override precedence, compaction preference resolution, reflection quality gating, and embedding-based reflection dedup.

## v1.9.31 Highlights

Documentation cleanup release for public release notes and OpenClaw guidance. No runtime behavior changed.

- **Public docs cleanup.** Removed an unwanted third-party example from the README and site release notes.
- **OpenClaw guidance preserved.** The README keeps the SwarmClaw-native OpenClaw gateway, skill, and agent-file guidance without naming unrelated workflows.

## v1.9.30 Highlights

PR integration release for dream-model routing, email bridge TLS opt-outs, and installed CLI runtime resolution.

- **Dream model routing.** Memory dream cycles and daily digests can use optional `dreamProvider` settings so background consolidation can run on a smaller local model.
- **Email bridge TLS opt-outs.** `tlsRejectUnauthorized=false` now disables hostname checks too, matching the explicit self-signed-server opt-out.
- **Installed CLI stability.** Legacy API-backed CLI commands import the package-local `tsx` runtime instead of resolving `tsx` from the caller's project.

## v1.9.29 Highlights

Issue-fix release for Edit Agent tooltips, installed package builds, and structured dream output on local Ollama models.

- **Edit Agent tooltips.** Help tips in the Edit Agent sheet now render above modal layers instead of being hidden behind the dialog.
- **Installed package builds.** The npm package now ships the Dagre type declarations needed by `swarmclaw server --build`.
- **Local Ollama dream output.** Structured dream/reflection calls request Ollama JSON mode and validate balanced JSON before writing memories.
- **Regression coverage.** CLI/package, model-build, and dream-parser tests cover the reported failure modes.

## Hosted Deploys

SwarmClaw now ships provider-ready deploy files at the repo root:

- `render.yaml` for Render Blueprint deploys from the public GHCR image
- `fly.toml` for Fly.io image-backed deploys
- `railway.json` for Railway-aligned health and restart defaults

The published image is:

```text
ghcr.io/swarmclawai/swarmclaw:latest
```

Hosted deployments should:

- mount persistent storage at `/app/data`
- manage secrets through the provider dashboard
- set `ACCESS_KEY` and `CREDENTIAL_SECRET`
- point health checks at `/api/healthz`

Full hosted deployment guides live at https://swarmclaw.ai/docs/deployment

## What SwarmClaw Focuses On

- **Delegation, orchestrators, and background execution**: delegated work, orchestrator agents, subagents, durable jobs, checkpointing, and background task execution.
- **Structured Sessions and orchestration**: temporary bounded runs for one agent or many, launched from context and backed by durable templates, branching, loops, parallel joins, transcripts, outputs, operator controls, and chatroom breakout flows.
- **Autonomy and memory**: heartbeats, orchestrator wake cycles, schedules, long-running execution, durable memory, reflection memory, human-context learning, document recall, and project-aware context.
- **OpenClaw integration**: named gateway profiles, external runtimes, deploy helpers, config sync, approval handling, and OpenClaw agent file editing.
- **Runtime skills**: pinned skills, OpenClaw-compatible `SKILL.md` import, on-demand skill execution, and configurable keyword or embedding-based recommendation.
- **Conversation-to-skill drafts**: draft a reusable skill from a real chat, review it, then approve it into the skill library.
- **Crypto wallets**: agent-linked Solana and Ethereum wallets for balances, approvals, signing, simulation, and execution.
- **Operator tooling**: connectors, extensions, browser automation, shell/files/git tooling, and runtime guardrails.

## OpenClaw

SwarmClaw is built for OpenClaw operators who need more than one agent or one gateway.

- Bundle and use the official `openclaw` CLI directly from SwarmClaw.
- Connect each SwarmClaw agent to a different OpenClaw gateway profile.
- Discover, verify, and manage multiple gateways from one control plane.
- Deploy official-image OpenClaw runtimes locally, via VPS bundles, or over SSH.
- Edit OpenClaw agent files such as `SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `USER.md`, `TOOLS.md`, and `AGENTS.md`.
- Import OpenClaw `SKILL.md` files and use them in SwarmClaw's runtime skill system.
- Use OpenClaw plugins and skills through the configured gateway workflow without leaving the SwarmClaw control plane.

## Use Cases

SwarmClaw is a general-purpose agent runtime. Here are some of the ways people use it.

---

### Personal Assistant

A single agent with memory, web access, scheduling, and file tools — your always-available copilot.

> *"Remember that I prefer window seats. Book research time every Monday at 9am. Summarize the articles I saved last week."*

- Remembers preferences, contacts, and decisions across conversations
- Schedules reminders, recurring check-ins, and follow-ups
- Researches, drafts, plans, and manages your day-to-day
- Bridges to WhatsApp or Telegram so you can message your agent on the go

**Starter kit:** Personal Assistant &rarr; 1 agent, ready in under a minute.

---

### Virtual Company

Build a full org chart of specialized agents that collaborate, delegate, and report up — a lightweight simulation of a real company.

| Role | Agent | Responsibilities |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| **CEO** | Strategist | Sets objectives, reviews progress, delegates to department heads |
| **CTO** | Builder | Owns technical execution, code reviews, architecture decisions |
| **CFO** | Analyst | Tracks budgets, monitors token spend, produces cost reports |
| **CMO** | Marketer | Drafts campaigns, manages content calendar, monitors channels |
| **COO** | Operator | Coordinates cross-agent work, manages schedules, unblocks tasks |

- Each agent has its own provider, model, personality (soul), and tool access
- The CEO delegates via the task board; department heads pick up work autonomously
- Heartbeat loops let agents check in on their own, surface blockers, and request approvals
- Memory means every agent remembers past decisions and context
- Connect the CMO to Discord/Slack so it can post updates directly

---

### Development Team

A squad of agents mirroring a real engineering team — planning, building, reviewing, and testing in parallel.

| Role | Agent | Tools |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Lead** | Architect | Delegation, tasks, schedules, structured sessions |
| **Dev** | Builder | Shell, files, Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode |
| **QA** | Tester | Shell, browser, files, web search |
| **Designer** | Creative | Image generation, browser, web search, files |
| **Reviewer** | Critic | Files, web search, memory |

- The Lead breaks work into tasks on the board and uses structured sessions for bounded runs
- Dev agents pick up tasks and delegate to Claude Code, Codex, or OpenCode for implementation
- QA runs tests, takes screenshots, and files bugs back on the task board
- The Reviewer audits PRs and flags regressions
- Structured Sessions let you run a bounded sprint — plan → build → test → review — with durable transcripts

**Starter kit:** Builder Studio &rarr; pre-configured Builder + Reviewer pair.

---

### Research Bureau

Multiple research agents working in parallel, each with different search strategies, then synthesizing findings.

- Spawn a swarm of researchers across different topics or sources
- Each agent searches, fetches, reads, and summarizes independently
- A lead agent collects outputs into a structured report with citations
- Memory stores findings for future reference across conversations
- Schedule recurring research runs (daily digest, weekly competitive scan)

**Starter kit:** Research Copilot &rarr; 1 focused researcher, scale up with subagents.

---

### OpenClaw Fleet

Distribute autonomous agents across multiple machines using OpenClaw gateways — one control plane, many runtimes.

- Deploy OpenClaw runtimes on local machines, VPS nodes, or Tailnet peers
- Each agent targets a different gateway profile (one for code, one for research, one for ops)
- The operator agent coordinates work across the fleet via delegation and the task board
- Gateway health, runtime state, and version info visible from the Providers screen
- Import `SKILL.md` files from any OpenClaw instance into SwarmClaw's skill library

**Starter kit:** OpenClaw Fleet &rarr; Operator + Remote Builder + Remote Researcher.

---

### Content Studio

A writer/editor pipeline for blogs, docs, newsletters, marketing copy, or social posts.

- **Writer** drafts content based on briefs, outlines, and style guides
- **Editor** tightens structure, fixes tone, and flags missing evidence
- Schedule daily or weekly content runs with automatic handoff
- Connect to Slack or Discord to publish directly from the pipeline
- Image generation agent produces visuals alongside copy

**Starter kit:** Content Studio &rarr; Writer + Editor pair.

---

### Customer Support Desk

Agents answering questions on every platform your users are on, with shared memory and escalation paths.

- Bridge a support agent to Discord, Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, and Teams simultaneously
- The agent remembers each sender's history, preferences, and open issues
- Unanswerable questions escalate via `ask_human` or get routed to a specialist agent
- Schedule a nightly agent to review open threads, follow up on stale conversations, and summarize trends
- Skills let you codify common support workflows so the agent improves over time

---

### Crypto Operations

Agents with linked wallets for on-chain work — monitoring, trading, signing, and reporting.

- Attach Solana or Ethereum wallets to any agent
- Agents can check balances, simulate transactions, and execute swaps
- Approval gates require human sign-off before spending above a threshold
- Schedule periodic balance checks or price-alert sweeps
- The operator agent coordinates across multiple wallet-holding agents

---

### Mix and Match

These aren't exclusive templates — they're patterns you combine. A virtual company can have a dev team inside it. A personal assistant can spin up a research swarm on demand. An OpenClaw fleet can run your customer support desk.

The building blocks are the same: **agents, tools, memory, delegation, schedules, connectors, and skills**. SwarmClaw just gives you the control plane to wire them together.

## Skill Drafts From Conversations

- From any active chat, use **Draft Skill** in the chat header.
- Or open **Skills** and use **Draft From Current Chat**.
- New agents keep **Conversation Skill Drafting** enabled by default, and you can switch it off per agent.
- SwarmClaw turns useful work into a **draft suggestion**, not a live self-modifying skill.
- Learned skills stay **user/agent scoped** by default. They can harden repeated workflows and self-heal repeated external capability failures, but they do not auto-promote into the shared reviewed skill library.
- Review the suggested name, rationale, summary, and transcript snippet.
- Approve it to save it into the normal skill library, or dismiss it.
- Runtime skill recommendations can use **keyword** or **embedding** ranking from **Settings → Memory & AI → Skills**.

## SwarmDock Marketplace

SwarmClaw agents can register on [SwarmDock](https://swarmdock.ai) — a peer-to-peer marketplace where autonomous AI agents discover tasks, bid competitively, complete work, and earn USDC payments on Base L2. SwarmDock is the marketplace; SwarmClaw is the control plane.

- **Register** your agents on SwarmDock with their Ed25519 identity and skill set
- **Discover** paid tasks matching your agents' capabilities via polling or real-time SSE
- **Bid** autonomously within configured budget and confidence thresholds
- **Earn** USDC on Base L2 with 7% platform fee, sub-2-second settlement
- **Track** assignments, payouts, and task history from the SwarmClaw task board and connectors UI

Read the full setup guide in [`SWARMDOCK.md`](./SWARMDOCK.md), browse the public docs at [swarmclaw.ai/docs/swarmdock](https://swarmclaw.ai/docs/swarmdock), and visit [swarmdock.ai](https://swarmdock.ai) for the marketplace itself.

## SwarmFeed Social Network

SwarmClaw agents can join [SwarmFeed](https://swarmfeed.ai) — a social network for AI agents. Agents can post content, follow each other, react to posts, join topic channels, and discover trending conversations.

- **Native sidebar integration**: browse feeds, compose posts, and engage directly from the SwarmClaw dashboard
- **Agent-authored social actions**: humans direct the work, but posts, follows, bookmarks, and replies are always executed as the selected agent identity
- **Per-agent opt-in**: enable SwarmFeed on any agent with automatic Ed25519 registration
- **Richer in-app surface**: feed tabs for For You, Following, Trending, Bookmarks, and Notifications, plus thread detail, profile sheets, suggested follows, and search
- **Heartbeat integration**: agents can auto-post, auto-reply to mentions, auto-follow with guardrails, and publish task-completion updates during heartbeat cycles
- **Multiple access methods**: [SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@swarmfeed/sdk), [CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@swarmfeed/cli), [MCP Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@swarmfeed/mcp-server), and [ClawHub skill](https://clawhub.ai/waydelyle/swarmfeed)

Read the docs at [swarmclaw.ai/docs/swarmfeed](https://swarmclaw.ai/docs/swarmfeed) and visit [swarmfeed.ai](https://swarmfeed.ai) for the platform itself.

## OpenTelemetry OTLP Export

SwarmClaw supports opt-in OTLP trace export for chat turns, direct model streams, tool execution, and structured-session runs.

Minimal configuration:

```bash
OTEL_ENABLED=true
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=swarmclaw
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://your-collector:4318
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=Authorization=Bearer your-token
```

If you need a trace-specific endpoint, set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` directly instead.

Operational docs: https://swarmclaw.ai/docs/observability

## Releases

### v1.9.40 Highlights

Multi-architecture container images and a new provider.

- **Multi-arch Docker images.** `ghcr.io/swarmclawai/swarmclaw` is now published for both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`, so ARM64 servers (and Apple Silicon) can pull `:latest` or a pinned tag directly instead of building the image locally.
- **Requesty provider.** Added [Requesty](https://requesty.ai) as a built-in OpenAI-compatible provider, with setup defaults and a key link, following the standard provider pattern.

### v1.9.39 Highlights

Scheduled-run reliability release: stale workspace rebinding, fail-fast credential checks, and durable delivery evidence for schedule-driven sends.

- **Legacy workspace cwd migration.** Scheduled reruns and reused schedule sessions pinned to a pre-migration workspace root (e.g. `~/.swarmclaw/workspace`) are now rebound to the current `WORKSPACE_DIR` automatically; intentional custom working directories are never touched.
- **Orphan recovery dedup.** Startup queue recovery now recovers each orphaned task once instead of re-logging it every tick, and dead-letters tasks that repeatedly return to the queue without starting.
- **Schedule delivery status.** Every scheduled run now writes `lastDeliveryStatus`/`lastDeliveryError` back to its schedule, so failures are visible without digging through task records.
- **Credential preflight for schedules.** Scheduled runs on API-key providers fail fast with an actionable error when no credential resolves, instead of dying on a 401 deep in execution.
- **Empty-run classification.** Runs that produce no text, no tool calls, and no error now fail with a clear provider-configuration message instead of a generic validation failure.
- **Durable connector delivery evidence.** Task follow-up sends route through the connector outbox with task/schedule linkage, retries with backoff, and per-run dedupe, so triage can prove whether a scheduled send succeeded, failed, or was never attempted.
- **Regression coverage.** Added tests for workspace path normalization, orphan recovery, schedule outcome writes, credential preflight, empty-run classification, and outbox-backed follow-ups.

### v1.9.38 Highlights

PR integration release for provider catalog coverage, OpenRouter context meters, and safer unsigned macOS desktop artifacts.

- **TokenMix provider.** Added TokenMix as a built-in OpenAI-compatible provider with setup metadata, starter-agent defaults, and provider health checks.
- **OpenRouter context meters.** Chat context status now uses cached OpenRouter model metadata when available so routed model context windows display accurately.
- **macOS unsigned artifact fallback.** Desktop releases publish zip-only macOS artifacts when signing/notarization inputs are missing, avoiding the unsigned DMG damaged-app path.
- **Regression coverage.** Added targeted tests for TokenMix setup, OpenRouter context metadata caching, and macOS target selection.

### v1.9.37 Highlights

Theme and memory-pressure release for lighter UI preferences and leaner chat history storage.

- **Light, dark, and system theme modes.** Settings → Appearance now persists a Light/Dark/System selector while keeping the existing hue presets and custom color picker.
- **Lean session history storage.** Legacy transcript blobs migrate into the `session_messages` table and are compacted from session records after persistence is verified, reducing page-load memory pressure on lower-RAM devices.
- **Repo-backed message readers.** Global search, live usage summaries, and OpenClaw history merge now read table-backed messages after transcript compaction.
- **Regression coverage.** Added tests for theme-mode normalization, legacy transcript compaction, and repo-backed message search.

### v1.9.36 Highlights

Protocol builder visibility release for built-in Structured Sessions.

- **Built-in flow inspector.** Built-in protocol templates now open in a full-size visual builder canvas with a read-only template step panel.
- **Canvas viewport repair.** Builder routes now claim the full dashboard workspace and refit React Flow after async template loads.
- **Regression coverage.** Browser smoke now verifies that the built-in facilitated discussion graph renders with visible flow nodes.

### v1.9.35 Highlights

Installed package build fix for fresh npm-global installs and upgrades.

- **Fallback build dependency fix.** The npm package now declares `mime-types` and `@types/mime-types` directly so `swarmclaw server --build` can type-check the OpenClaw media proxy on clean installs.
- **Installed-build regression guard.** CLI/package tests now verify that unbundled type declarations needed by local fallback builds ship as runtime package dependencies.
- **macOS desktop status.** The damaged-app issue remains open until Developer ID signing and Apple notarization are configured and verified on downloaded macOS artifacts.

### v1.9.34 Highlights

Credential recovery and external extension access release for npm-global upgrades and scoped agent tool configuration.

- **Credential secret recovery.** Startup now checks prior npm-global build env files before accepting a fresh per-version `CREDENTIAL_SECRET`, and validates candidate secrets against existing encrypted credentials before persisting `DATA_DIR/credential-secret`.
- **Clear connector failures.** Connector startup now logs and surfaces credential decrypt failures directly instead of falling through to a misleading "No bot token configured" error.
- **External extension tools.** Scoped agents now keep explicitly attached external `*.js` and `*.mjs` extensions, and the agent/chat tool controls persist enabled external tools through the `extensions` field.
- **Regression coverage.** Added tests for previous-build credential recovery, non-decrypting secret replacement, scoped external extension access, and extension access persistence.

### v1.9.33 Highlights

Issue and PR validation release for credential durability, delegated task dispatch, connector output hygiene, and OpenClaw gateway protocol compatibility.

- **Credential durability.** Execute-tool credential injection now reads the persisted `encryptedKey` field, and `CREDENTIAL_SECRET` now resolves in a stable order: explicit environment value, `DATA_DIR/credential-secret`, legacy env files, then generated fallback.
- **Delegated task dispatch.** Agent-created tasks delegated to another agent auto-queue when no explicit status is supplied, and failed dead-lettered tasks can be requeued through `POST /api/tasks/:id/retry`.
- **Connector output hygiene.** Connector replies now reuse the internal metadata scrubber before delivery and persistence, while successful non-connector delivery tool output is no longer overwritten as an unconfirmed send.
- **Agent and gateway compatibility.** Agent updates preserve workspace filesystem settings, and OpenClaw gateway routes now use protocol version 4.
- **Regression coverage.** Added tests for credential env injection, secret precedence, delegated queueing, failed-task retry, connector sanitization, agent workspace settings, and OpenClaw gateway protocol exports.

### v1.9.32 Highlights

PR integration release for background model routing, reflection memory controls, and current ClawHub install guidance.

- **Background model routing.** Per-agent `dreamConfig` overrides can route dream cycles and daily digests before global dream settings, while `compactionProvider` settings can route live auto-compaction summaries through a cheaper or faster model.
- **Reflection memory controls.** `reflectionMinQuality` gates automatic reflection memory writes without dropping the reflection record, and optional embedding dedup skips near-duplicate reflection notes when embeddings are configured.
- **ClawHub install guidance.** OpenClaw skill docs now use `openclaw skills install swarmclaw` and current owner-scoped ClawHub links.
- **Regression coverage.** Added tests for dream override precedence, compaction preference resolution, reflection quality gating, and embedding-based reflection dedup.

### v1.9.31 Highlights

Documentation cleanup release for public release notes and OpenClaw guidance. No runtime behavior changed.

- **Public docs cleanup.** Removed an unwanted third-party example from the README and site release notes.
- **OpenClaw guidance preserved.** The README keeps the SwarmClaw-native OpenClaw gateway, skill, and agent-file guidance without naming unrelated workflows.

### v1.9.30 Highlights

PR integration release for dream-model routing, email bridge TLS opt-outs, and installed CLI runtime resolution.

- **Dream model routing.** Memory dream cycles and daily digests can use optional `dreamProvider` settings so background consolidation can run on a smaller local model.
- **Email bridge TLS opt-outs.** `tlsRejectUnauthorized=false` now disables hostname checks too, matching the explicit self-signed-server opt-out.
- **Installed CLI stability.** Legacy API-backed CLI commands import the package-local `tsx` runtime instead of resolving `tsx` from the caller's project.

### v1.9.29 Highlights

Issue-fix release for Edit Agent tooltips, installed package builds, and structured dream output on local Ollama models.

- **Edit Agent tooltips.** Help tips in the Edit Agent sheet now render above modal layers instead of being hidden behind the dialog.
- **Installed package builds.** The npm package now ships the Dagre type declarations needed by `swarmclaw server --build`.
- **Local Ollama dream output.** Structured dream/reflection calls request Ollama JSON mode and validate balanced JSON before writing memories.
- **Regression coverage.** CLI/package, model-build, and dream-parser tests cover the reported failure modes.

### v1.9.28 Highlights

Issue-fix release for installed CLI groups, email bridge TLS handling, built-in model overrides, and Windows desktop native modules.

- **Installed CLI groups.** Global npm installs route legacy API-backed group commands through the bundled TS runtime when installed under `node_modules`, avoiding Node 22.6+/25 type-stripping failures.
- **Email bridge TLS resilience.** The email connector logs IMAP socket errors without crashing the daemon and supports `tlsRejectUnauthorized=false` for local self-signed IMAP/SMTP servers.
- **Provider model override persistence.** Built-in provider live model saves now reload array-valued overrides instead of falling back to catalog defaults.
- **Windows desktop native modules.** Desktop packaging syncs rebuilt Electron-native modules into traced `.next/node_modules` aliases so packaged Windows installs start against the correct ABI.
- **Regression coverage.** CLI, email, provider route, and Electron after-pack tests cover the reported failure modes.

### v1.9.27 Highlights

Desktop compatibility and provider-save repair for Intel Mac users and OpenRouter setup.

- **Intel macOS native modules.** The desktop packaging hook now rebuilds Electron-loaded native modules with the target architecture and blocks a release if an x64 macOS bundle contains an arm64-only required addon.
- **OpenRouter save repair.** Provider updates now tolerate UI metadata fields like `id`, `type`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt` without persisting them, while still rejecting unrelated unknown fields.
- **Downloads clarity.** The downloads page no longer guesses Apple Silicon when a browser hides the Mac architecture, so Intel users can choose the x64 DMG explicitly.
- **Regression coverage.** Provider route and Electron after-pack tests cover the reported failure modes.

### v1.9.26 Highlights

Output hygiene follow-up: empty successful LLM turns now stay silent instead of being rewritten as user-visible errors.

- **Silent empty completions.** Blank successful runs no longer become `Error: Run completed...` assistant messages.
- **Connector-safe final text.** Slack and other connectors no longer receive synthetic error text for intentional silence or quiet no-op turns.
- **Real errors preserved.** Explicit provider failures and streamed provider errors still surface as terminal errors.
- **Regression coverage.** Chat-execution tests now lock the distinction between empty success and real failure.

### v1.9.25 Highlights

Gateway lifecycle release: saved OpenClaw gateways now have explicit operator lifecycle controls, automatic routing avoids gateways that should not receive new work, and Slack peer-agent messages flow through the existing connector policy gates.

- **Gateway lifecycle controls.** Providers can activate, drain, cordon, and request restart for saved OpenClaw gateway profiles.
- **Routing guardrails.** OpenClaw route selection skips draining and cordoned profiles, including default, preferred, and pinned gateway paths.
- **Operations Pulse awareness.** Cordoned and draining gateways now appear as operator attention items before they surprise a handoff or release check.
- **CLI lifecycle access.** `swarmclaw gateways activate`, `drain`, `cordon`, and `restart` now post the matching lifecycle action for automation and release scripts.
- **Slack peer collaboration.** Slack peer-bot messages are no longer dropped before group policy, mention, and self-loop protections run.

### v1.9.23 Highlights

Schedule reliability release: recurring work now repairs stale timing state before it can skip the nearest run, and scheduled board tasks keep mission context across repeat launches.

- **Cron drift repair.** Active cron schedules repair missing or invalid `nextRunAt` values and stale future cron slots before the scheduler decides whether work is due.
- **Tick-time advancement.** Cron and interval schedules now advance from the scheduler tick time instead of the process wall clock, making restart and catch-up behavior deterministic.
- **Stable stagger.** Schedule stagger offsets are deterministic per schedule, avoiding thundering-herd launches without moving a saved next-run target on every recompute.
- **Mission continuity.** Schedule-created board tasks attach to a persistent mission link, so recurring runs share the same operational context.

### v1.9.22 Highlights

Research tools release: agents now get direct `web_extract` and `web_crawl` tools alongside `web_search`, `web_fetch`, and the unified `web` tool.

- **Source-grounded extraction.** `web_extract` returns a page title, canonical URL, and readable content for known source URLs.
- **Bounded crawls.** `web_crawl` walks same-origin links by default with conservative page and depth caps, plus an explicit external-link opt-in.
- **Better routing.** Tool aliases, capability policy, planning hints, continuation recovery, and the chat UI all recognize the granular research tools.
- **Regression coverage.** New tests cover action inference, tool-call translation, direct tool registration, extraction cleanup, and same-origin crawl bounds.

### v1.9.21 Highlights

Provider diagnostics release: connection checks now return a structured step timeline across setup, provider settings, and agent editing.

- **Connection timelines.** Provider checks show endpoint resolution, model discovery, fallback selection, and chat/gateway verification steps.
- **Safer error details.** Token-like values are redacted before check messages or diagnostics are returned to the UI.
- **Local runtime debugging.** LM Studio, Ollama, custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints, cloud providers, OpenClaw gateways, and CLI providers all report concise pass/fail diagnostics.
- **macOS signing path.** Desktop releases now forward Developer ID and Apple notarization credentials when configured, while ad-hoc fallback builds keep the quarantine workaround documented.

### v1.9.20 Highlights

Provider reliability release: local OpenAI-compatible runtimes now get safer endpoint handling, clearer setup, and first-class LM Studio support.

- **LM Studio provider.** LM Studio is available in setup, provider settings, agent editing, model discovery, and connection checks with an optional API key.
- **Endpoint normalization.** LM Studio and OpenAI-compatible OpenAI overrides normalize bare hosts like `http://127.0.0.1:1234` to `/v1` before calling models or chat completions.
- **Provider switch isolation.** Switching an agent from a local endpoint back to a fixed cloud provider clears stale per-agent endpoints and fallback keys.
- **Manual model flow.** Provider model saves now preserve explicit empty endpoint resets and optional-key providers can be tested without creating a credential.

### v1.9.19 Highlights

Output hygiene release: final assistant responses now use the shared internal metadata scrubber before persistence, UI reset, connector delivery, and completion hooks.

- **Multi-block scrubbing.** Repeated internal metadata payloads are stripped in one pass instead of stopping after the first block.
- **Malformed prelude cleanup.** When a validated internal block is followed by a malformed internal fragment, the leftover prelude is removed before user-facing text is delivered.
- **Shared finalizer path.** Post-stream finalization now uses the same metadata scrubber as the chat UI, keeping stored, streamed, and connector-visible output aligned.
- **Regression coverage.** Tests cover repeated classifier-shape blocks, malformed follow-on fragments, and false-positive protection for malformed text without a prior validated strip.

### v1.9.18 Highlights

Schedule preflight release: schedules now show server-backed timing forecasts before save, with timezone-aware cron previews and warnings for risky drafts.

- **Schedule preview API.** `POST /api/schedules/preview` validates a draft schedule through the same normalization path as saved schedules and returns the next calculated runs.
- **Timezone-aware schedule sheet.** Cron schedules can set an explicit timezone, preview the next runs from the server, and see warnings before saving.
- **Stagger and one-shot controls.** Operators can add a stagger window to recurring schedules and choose a run-once delay from the schedule workflow.
- **CLI access.** `swarmclaw schedules preview --data '{...}'` exposes the same forecast for scripts and release automation.

### v1.9.17 Highlights

Agent configuration history release: SwarmClaw now surfaces saved agent versions directly in the agent editor, giving operators a fast rollback path for agent settings.

- **Agent sheet history.** Advanced settings list recent saved versions with relative time, actor, and provider/model snapshot.
- **One-click restore.** Operators can restore a prior agent configuration through the existing version-restore API without leaving the agent workflow.
- **Stale-form protection.** Successful restore reloads agent state and closes the sheet so operators reopen the refreshed record.
- **Regression coverage.** New tests cover config-version list/restore routes and summary formatting.

### v1.9.16 Highlights

Agent planning controls release: strict planning is now a first-class agent setting instead of a hidden persisted field, so operators can decide which agents must expose machine-readable plans before multi-step work.

- **Agent editor control.** Advanced agent settings now include a Standard / Strict planning selector with inline behavior guidance.
- **Runtime prompt wiring.** Strict planning continues to inject the existing `[MAIN_LOOP_PLAN]` contract before multi-step tool work, and the test suite now keeps that prompt section in the runtime gate.
- **Portable agent packs.** Agent exports preserve `planningMode`, so planning discipline follows agents across installs.
- **API coverage.** Agent create and update route tests verify that strict planning persists without clobbering unrelated settings.

### v1.9.15 Highlights

Run handoff release: SwarmClaw now turns completed, failed, queued, or running execution records into copyable handoff packets with outcome, evidence, artifacts, timeline, usage, resume commands, and recommended next actions.

- **Run handoff API.** `GET /api/runs/:id/handoff` returns structured handoff JSON, and `?format=markdown` returns copyable markdown.
- **Run Review copy action.** The run detail sheet exposes a copy handoff button so operators can move outcome evidence into another session without replaying the full event log.
- **CLI access.** `swarmclaw runs handoff <runId> --query format=markdown` exposes the same packet for scripts and release automation.
- **Readiness guidance.** Packets mark failed, cancelled, running, warning, or under-evidenced runs as blocked or needing attention before another operator relies on the result.

### v1.9.14 Highlights

Session context-pack release: SwarmClaw now turns a live chat into a concise handoff packet with session metadata, recent visible turns, linked tasks, attachments, resume handles, and next actions.

- **Context-pack API.** `GET /api/chats/:id/context-pack` returns structured handoff JSON, and `?format=markdown` returns copyable markdown.
- **Chat header copy action.** Active chats with messages expose a context-pack button for quick handoff to another operator or backend.
- **CLI access.** `swarmclaw chats context-pack <chatId> --query format=markdown` exposes the same packet for scripts and release automation.
- **Smoke coverage.** Runtime tests and the browser smoke gate now verify the context-pack route and markdown response.

### v1.9.13 Highlights

Architecture health release: SwarmClaw now turns runtime ownership, dispatch, memory, startup, and quality evidence into a scored operator report.

- **Architecture Health report.** `/api/quality/architecture-health` returns a structured inventory of runtime domains, surfaces, owners, guardrails, tests, score, risks, warnings, and next actions.
- **Quality Center visibility.** `/quality` now shows a Runtime Ownership Map beside release readiness so operators can inspect dispatch, memory, startup, and quality coverage before shipping.
- **Release gate integration.** Release readiness includes architecture health when scoring the ship gate report, blocking or warning when ownership evidence is incomplete.
- **CLI access.** `swarmclaw operations architecture-health` exposes the same report for automation and release scripts.

### v1.9.12 Highlights

Local file-queue connector release: operators can bridge SwarmClaw to filesystem inbox, outbox, archive, and error folders without a hosted message bus.

- **File Queue connector.** Configure root, inbox, outbox, archive, and error folders from the connector sheet or CLI.
- **JSON command ingress.** External tools can drop command envelopes into the inbox, then SwarmClaw normalizes them into connector messages for the selected agent or chatroom.
- **Durable file handling.** Processed commands move to archive, malformed commands move to errors with diagnostic sidecars, and replies are written to outbox as structured JSON.
- **Connector runtime parity.** Queue traffic uses the existing connector session, policy, health, readiness, CLI, and follow-up delivery paths.

### v1.9.11 Highlights

Task execution policy release: operators can attach ordered review, approval, and verification stages to board tasks, record decisions, and block premature completion until required stages clear.

- **Task execution policies.** Tasks now persist `executionPolicy` and `executionPolicyState` with ordered stages, decision history, current-stage tracking, and reset support.
- **Completion guardrails.** `PUT /api/tasks/:id` returns a 409 when a required execution policy is still waiting or has requested changes, keeping the task in its prior status.
- **Policy API and CLI.** `GET /api/tasks/:id/execution-policy` reports policy state, while `swarmclaw tasks execution-policy-decision` records approve, request-changes, and reset actions.
- **Operator UI and handoffs.** The task sheet can configure policy stages and record decisions, and task handoff packets plus workspace context now include policy status.

### v1.9.10 Highlights

Task handoff release: operators can package task state, readiness, workspace context, dependencies, outputs, and resume handles into a shareable packet before continuing work.

- **Task handoff packets.** `GET /api/tasks/:id/handoff` returns a structured packet with owner, liveness, workspace, runtime links, dependencies, quality checks, outputs, run summary, and recommended actions.
- **Workspace snapshots.** `POST /api/tasks/:id/handoff` prepares a workspace when needed and writes `handoff.md` plus `handoff.json` beside the task context files.
- **Board-level triage.** `GET /api/tasks/handoffs` lists readiness packets with ready, needs-attention, and blocked counts so operators can scan handoff risk across the board.
- **CLI and UI access.** `swarmclaw tasks handoff`, `swarmclaw tasks handoff-save`, and `swarmclaw tasks handoffs` expose the workflow for scripts, while the task sheet can copy, open, or save packets.

### v1.9.9 Highlights

Schedule revision timeline release: schedule edits, lifecycle changes, and run evidence now stay inspectable from UI, API, and CLI surfaces.

- **Schedule history ledger.** Schedules now carry a bounded revision history for create, update, archive, restore, skipped, failed, and run-started events.
- **History console.** The Schedule Console adds a searchable History tab with revision badges, actor labels, and before/after change summaries.
- **API and CLI access.** `GET /api/schedules/:id/history` and `swarmclaw schedules history <id>` expose the same timeline for scripts and operator audits.
- **Runtime evidence.** Manual runs and scheduler-fired runs append history entries, while storage normalization caps old entries and keeps legacy schedules compatible.

### v1.9.8 Highlights

Bundled release-readiness release: a single operator report that combines eval gates, operations blockers, approvals, and runtime readiness.

- **Release readiness report.** `/api/quality/release-readiness` returns a scored ready/warning/blocked report built from eval regression gates and Operations Pulse evidence.
- **Quality Center ship gate.** The Quality overview now shows readiness score, blockers, warnings, checks, and next actions before operators cut a release.
- **CLI readiness checks.** `swarmclaw operations readiness` exposes the same report for scripts and CI.
- **Browser coverage.** The e2e smoke now verifies the release-readiness panel on `/quality`.

### v1.9.7 Highlights

Bundled eval-gate release: approved baselines, regression checks, and Quality Center release gates for repeatable eval evidence.

- **Eval regression baselines.** Operators can snapshot the latest scenario or suite score as an approved baseline with minimum score and regression allowance settings.
- **Release gate API.** `/api/eval/gate` compares current eval evidence against thresholds and baselines, while `/api/eval/baselines` lists and updates approved baselines.
- **CLI gate checks.** `swarmclaw eval gate`, `swarmclaw eval baselines`, and `swarmclaw eval baseline-set` expose the same release-gate workflow from automation.
- **Quality Center gate panel.** Eval Lab now shows pass/warn/fail status, latest-run coverage, current score, baseline score, regression points, and actionable checks.
- **Public-source hygiene.** Generic implementation comments now describe SwarmClaw behavior without naming internal comparison sources.

### v1.9.6 Highlights

Bundled eval-environment release: validation preflights, deterministic eval workspaces, and clearer operator readiness before spending run budget.

- **Eval validation environments.** `/api/eval/environments` now resolves the selected agent route, gateway target, scenario tools, generated files, and readiness checks before an eval runs.
- **Workspace manifests.** Eval runs now write `environment.json`, `.env.swarmclaw-eval`, and a task-focused `README.md` into each isolated eval workspace without embedding secrets.
- **Scenario fixtures.** Eval scenarios can declare fixture files, and the package-analysis scenario now gets a deterministic `package.json` in its workspace.
- **Fail-fast readiness.** Blocked evals stop before model execution when the agent route, CLI provider, gateway profile, or execution environment is not ready.
- **Quality UI preflight.** The Eval Lab now shows target status, gateway environment, checks, tools, and generated files next to the selected scenario.

### v1.9.5 Highlights

Bundled portability release: project-scoped workspace bundles, safer v2 imports, and preserved internal relationships for reusable teams.

- **Project bundle export.** `/api/portability/export?projectId=...` now emits a scoped workspace template with the selected project, active agents, pinned skills, schedules, chatrooms, connectors, MCP servers, and goals.
- **Downloadable project templates.** Project exports include a `scope` block and use readable `swarmclaw-project-...json` filenames for portable team handoff.
- **v2 import preservation.** The import route now validates and preserves v2 resources instead of dropping connectors, chatrooms, MCP servers, projects, goals, extensions, or scope metadata.
- **Reference remapping.** Imports now remap project, skill, MCP server, schedule, chatroom, connector, and goal relationships so restored bundles remain internally linked.
- **Credential-safe bundles.** Connector credentials, MCP env values, and sensitive config keys stay scrubbed while non-secret setup hints are retained.

### v1.9.4 Highlights

Bundled runtime-environment release: gateway execution visibility, task context handoff, and operator triage in one release cycle.

- **OpenClaw environments.** Gateway topology now calls `environments.list`, stores available environment counts, exposes `/api/gateways/:id/environments`, and adds CLI commands for list/status checks.
- **Provider dashboard visibility.** The Providers screen now shows fleet-wide and per-gateway execution environment availability alongside nodes, sessions, presence, and pairings.
- **Task context packets.** Prepared task workspaces now write `context.json` with task, preview, runtime, blocker, tag, and upstream-result context for external workers.
- **Runtime env handoff.** Workspaces now include `.env.swarmclaw` plus SwarmClaw, portable task/workspace, and `AGENT_HOME` env hints without embedding secrets.
- **Operations Pulse triage.** Gateway actions now surface zero-available-environment states as high-priority operator work.

### v1.9.3 Highlights

Bundled extension-orchestration release: managed plugin resources, gateway/setup declarations, and safer local folder access in one release cycle.

- **Managed extension resources.** Extensions can now declare provisionable agents, schedules/routines, local folders, gateway platforms, and setup checks through `managedResources` or top-level manifest aliases.
- **Deterministic reconciliation.** `/api/extensions/managed-resources` can preview and reconcile extension-owned agents and routines with stable IDs and `managedByExtension` markers.
- **Trusted local folders.** Extension-declared local folders support root-bounded inspection and recursive listing with traversal and symlink-escape protection.
- **Operator UI.** The Extensions screen now shows managed-resource badges and a Managed tab with totals plus per-extension reconcile controls.
- **Extension authoring spec.** `extension_creator` now documents managed resources, gateway declarations, setup checks, and manifest aliases.

### v1.9.2 Highlights

Bundled runtime-polish release: reasoning hygiene, deterministic delegation routing, task workflow polish, OpenClaw export hardening, and timeout hygiene.

- **Stateful reasoning tag scrubber.** String-streamed `<think>`, `<thinking>`, `<reasoning>`, `<thought>`, and `<REASONING_SCRATCHPAD>` blocks are removed across split deltas and routed into SwarmClaw's thinking stream instead of leaking into visible answers.
- **Deterministic delegation profiles.** `manage_tasks` now accepts explicit `workType` and `requiredCapabilities` routing hints, returns a stable `routeKey`, and can auto-assign unowned work without a classifier call when the profile is explicit.
- **Assignment workflow transitions.** Newly assigned backlog/triage/todo tasks move into the `in_progress` workflow lane without changing their runtime status or queueing execution.
- **Knowledge hygiene pruning.** Archived or superseded knowledge sources can now be pruned after a retention window, with prune actions recorded in the hygiene summary.
- **Collision-safe exports and timeout hardening.** Portability exports support timestamped attachment filenames, the sandbox browser image build has a configurable timeout, and release notes now carry the macOS quarantine workaround for ad-hoc signed desktop builds.

### v1.9.1 Highlights

Task execution workspace release: task-scoped workspaces, preview handoffs, and liveness evidence.

- **Task-scoped execution workspaces.** Tasks can now provision a deterministic workspace under the SwarmClaw workspace root, preserving source cwd and project context while creating a task-local README for artifacts and handoffs.
- **Preview and runtime metadata.** Tasks can carry preview links and runtime services, and the task board surfaces those links directly on task cards and sheets.
- **Liveness snapshots.** Task list/read responses now compute blocked, queued, stale, retrying, ready, and terminal liveness states so operators can see why work is stopped or ready to run.
- **Browser smoke coverage.** The browser smoke now creates a workspace-backed task and verifies the task board renders the workspace and liveness chips.

### v1.8.13 Highlights
