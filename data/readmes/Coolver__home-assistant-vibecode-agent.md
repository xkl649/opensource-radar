**Let AI build your Home Assistant automations – or act as your DevOps for the ones you write by hand. Just describe what you need in natural language. 🏠🤖**

You describe your goal → AI inspects your Home Assistant → designs a custom solution → and deploys it on-board automatically. 🚀

And if you prefer to handcraft your automations and scripts yourself, the agent can simply act as your DevOps and extra pair of hands: quickly uploading your changes, running tests, and analyzing logs on demand. **You stay in control and decide how much you delegate to AI and how deep it should go.**

Transform the way you manage your smart home. This agent enables **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**, or any **MCP-enabled IDE** to:

- 📝 Analyze your Home Assistant configuration, entities, and devices  
- 🏗️ Create intelligent automations, scripts, and complete systems — including Home Assistant helpers that can be fully managed programmatically  
- 🎨 Design and customize UI dashboards with full control over cards, layouts, and styling  
- 🖌️ Create and tweak themes for a personalized UI  
- 🔄 Safely deploy changes with automatic Git-based versioning  
- 🔍 Monitor and troubleshoot your setup through log analysis  
- 📦 Install and manage HACS integrations and custom repositories  

No more manual YAML editing or searching through documentation - just describe what you want in natural language!

**Real example:** User says *"Install smart climate control"* → AI analyzes 7 TRVs, creates 10 automations + 9 helpers + 10 sensors + 5 scripts, deploys everything, and it just works!

## 🎯 What is this?

**HA Vibecode Agent** is a service that exposes a safe REST API and toolset, allowing AI assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, Antigravity, and any MCP-enabled IDE) to safely work *with* your Home Assistant instead of just generating YAML in the dark.

It supports two deployment modes:

| Mode | For whom | How it runs |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Supervisor (Add-on)** | Home Assistant OS / Supervised | Installed via HA Add-on Store (default) |
| **Standalone (Docker)** | HA Container in Docker / Proxmox / NAS | Runs as a separate Docker container |

Both modes provide the same core functionality. The only difference: **Add-on management** (install/uninstall/restart add-ons) requires the Supervisor and is not available in standalone mode.

### 🚀 How is this different from other MCP modules for Home Assistant?

# Home Assistant Agent + MCP Server

Most MCP integrations for Claude, Cursor, VS Code or Antigravity run only on your local machine and talk to Home Assistant over SSH, sometimes with the REST API.

For serious Home Assistant work, that is not enough.

Home Assistant is not just a set of YAML files. It exposes internal APIs, runtime state, entities, services and capabilities that are much easier and safer to access from inside Home Assistant itself.

SSH-based integrations often force the AI to generate and run temporary helper scripts on every request. Since those scripts can change every time, the result is hard to predict, hard to repeat and risky to rely on.

This project uses a different architecture.

## Architecture

The project is split into two modules:

### Home Assistant Agent

Runs inside, or alongside, Home Assistant.

It has native access to relevant APIs, files, entities, services and runtime state, and exposes a safe, well-defined interface for external tools.

### Home Assistant MCP Server

Runs on your computer alongside your AI IDE, such as Cursor, VS Code, Claude Desktop or Antigravity.

It talks to the Agent over a controlled API instead of relying on SSH hacks.

## Why this design

This makes Home Assistant automation faster, safer, more predictable and repeatable.

The AI IDE gets exactly the actions and data it needs through a stable API, instead of constantly inventing ad-hoc scripts.

It also improves context efficiency.

Instead of loading huge YAML files, full entity dumps, logs or generated scripts into the prompt, the Agent can return only the relevant context: selected entities, services, automation fragments, validation results, errors or structured summaries.

The result is less noise, fewer tokens, fewer wrong assumptions and more reliable edits.

## In short

The MCP server gives your AI IDE a standard way to talk to Home Assistant.

The Agent gives it safe, native access to Home Assistant itself.

**Together, they replace fragile SSH-based scripting with a stable, structured and context-efficient automation layer**

## ⚡ Installation (5 minutes)

### Option A: Home Assistant Add-on (default, recommended)

**For users running Home Assistant OS or Supervised installation.**

This is the standard deployment — the agent runs as a managed add-on inside Home Assistant with full access to Supervisor API.

#### 1. Add Repository

Open your **Home Assistant UI** (usually http://homeassistant.local:8123):

1. Go to **Settings** → **Add-ons** → **Add-on Store** → **⋮** → **Repositories** (usually http://homeassistant.local:8123/hassio/dashboard )
2. Add: `https://github.com/coolver/home-assistant-vibecode-agent`
3. Click **Add**

#### 2. Install and Start Add-on

Still in **Home Assistant UI**:

1. Refresh the page
2. Find **HA Vibecode Agent** → Click **INSTALL**
3. Wait for installation to complete
4. Enable → **Start on boot: ON** → and push **START** button
5. **Wait for startup** (~10 seconds)
6. Click **"Open Web UI"** button

You'll see this interface:

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/images/ingress-panel.jpg" alt="HA Vibecode Agent Ingress Panel" width="700">
</p>

7. Click the **Cursor** or **VS Code** tab (depending on which IDE you want to use with Home Assistant) and **follow the setup instructions**. You'll need to install and configure Cursor or VS Code so they can connect to the HA Agent via the MCP protocol.

8. That's it — **you're ready to start** working with your Home Assistant scripts, automations and dashboards using AI.

### Option B: Standalone Docker (Proxmox / Docker / NAS)

**For users running Home Assistant Container without Supervisor** (e.g., in Proxmox LXC/VM, Synology NAS, or plain Docker Compose).

The agent runs as a separate Docker container alongside your Home Assistant instance and connects via a Long-Lived Access Token.

#### Prerequisites

- Home Assistant running and accessible over the network
- **Long-Lived Access Token** — create one in HA UI: **Profile** (bottom-left) → **Long-Lived Access Tokens** → **Create Token**
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on the host

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Coolver/home-assistant-vibecode-agent.git
cd home-assistant-vibecode-agent
```

#### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your values:

```env
HA_URL=http://192.168.1.100:8123
HA_TOKEN=your_long_lived_access_token_here
HA_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/homeassistant/config
```

#### 3. Start the agent

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.standalone.yml up -d
```

#### 4. Get the API key

The agent auto-generates an API key on first start. View it in the logs:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.standalone.yml logs | grep "API Key"
```

Or read it directly from the config directory:

```bash
cat /path/to/homeassistant/config/.ha_cursor_agent_key
```

#### 5. Configure your IDE

The agent is now available at `http://<host-ip>:8099`. Configure your MCP client (Cursor, VS Code, etc.) to connect using the API key from step 4.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "spawn npx ENOENT" error (Claude Code / Cursor / VS Code / Other IDE Console)

This error means Node.js is not installed or not found in your system PATH.

Solution: Install Node.js (v20.0.0 or higher; Node.js 24 LTS recommended) on the computer where Cursor is running:

Download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org
Restart Cursor completely after installation
Verify installation by running node --version in a terminal
Important: Node.js must be installed on your computer (where Cursor runs), not on the Home Assistant server.


### Add-on won't start

**Check logs:** Supervisor → HA Vibecode Agent → Logs

Common issues:
- Port 8099 already in use
- Invalid configuration
- Missing permissions

### Standalone container won't start

**Check logs:** `docker compose -f docker-compose.standalone.yml logs`

Common issues:
- `HA_URL` not set or unreachable
- `HA_TOKEN` invalid or expired — regenerate in HA UI → Profile → Long-Lived Access Tokens
- Config volume not mounted correctly — verify `HA_CONFIG_PATH` in `.env`

### API returns 401 Unauthorized

- Check Agent Key is correct
- Regenerate key if needed: Settings → Add-ons → HA Vibecode Agent → Open Web UI (add-on mode), or read from `/config/.ha_cursor_agent_key` (standalone mode)
- Ensure Authorization header is present
- Format: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AGENT_KEY`

### File operations fail

- Check file paths are relative to `/config`
- Ensure files exist for read/delete operations
- Check YAML syntax for parse errors

### Git versioning not working

- Git versioning is always enabled in shadow repository (`/config/ha_vibecode_git`)
- Check `git_versioning_auto` setting for auto/manual commit mode
- View logs for Git errors
- Ensure `/config` is writable
