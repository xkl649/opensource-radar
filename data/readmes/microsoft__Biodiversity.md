## 📣 Announcements

### What we've been up to

Our journey started with **MegaDetector** — a camera-trap animal detection model that became a widely adopted tool in the conservation community. Building on that foundation, we created **PyTorch-Wildlife** as a unified platform to host all of our AI for biodiversity work, bringing together detection, classification, and eventually much more.

Over time, our scope grew well beyond camera-trap imagery. We now have active work in bioacoustics, overhead animal detection, and edge computing for remote field deployments. As the ecosystem expanded, it became clear that keeping everything inside a single repository was working against us. Code was harder to find, harder to maintain, and harder to extend.

So we made a deliberate decision: break the work into focused, dedicated repositories — one per project — where the code in each repo is concentrated, the ownership is clear, and future contributors know exactly where to go. This repository is the hub that ties them together. PyTorch-Wildlife now lives at [microsoft/Pytorch-Wildlife](https://github.com/microsoft/Pytorch-Wildlife), MegaDetector at [microsoft/MegaDetector](https://github.com/microsoft/MegaDetector), and everything else is linked in the table below.
