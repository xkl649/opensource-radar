Entries with thin public documentation are marked `verify`.

**Status:** `ready` = usable as an app or service · `adapt` = needs setup or customization · `infra` = building block · `verify` = re-check before relying on the description

**Platform:** `Android` / `iOS` / `Windows` / `Web` … = where it runs · `Self-host` = runs on your own server/machine · `Cloud` = hosted third-party service · `Browser` = extension/userscript · `CLI` = terminal tool · `Any` = host-agnostic · app names (`AstrBot`, `Claude Code`, `Kelivo`, `SillyTavern`…) = plugs into that host
