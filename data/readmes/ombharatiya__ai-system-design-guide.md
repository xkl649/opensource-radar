## 🎯 Why This Guide

**Traditional books are outdated before they ship.** This is a living document: when new models release, when patterns evolve, this updates.

| This Guide | Printed Books |
|------------|---------------|
| August 2026 models (Claude Opus 5, Sonnet 5, Fable 5, GPT-5.6 Sol/Terra/Luna, GPT-5.6-Cyber, Gemini 3.7 Flash, Grok 4.6, DeepSeek V4, Kimi K3, Qwen3.8, GLM-5.3, Muse Glimmer, Inkling) | Stuck on GPT-4 |
| MCP 2.0, A2A v1.0, OpenClaw, Computer Use, Agentic RAG, ColBERT, latent reasoning, MoE serving | Does not exist |
| Real pricing with August 2026 verification dates | Already wrong |
| Staff-level interview Q&A (128 questions through August 2026) + Job Market Trends | Generic questions |

**Quick model picker (August 2026):** Claude Fable 5 for the capability ceiling ($10/$50 per 1M), Claude Opus 5 for long-horizon agentic coding at $5/$25, Claude Sonnet 5 as the production default ($2/$10, now permanent), GPT-5.6 Terra for general production ($2/$12) with Luna at $0.20/$1.20 for volume tiers, Gemini 3.7 Flash at a half-price $0.75/$3.75 through year-end, Kimi K3 or Muse Glimmer for open weights. Note that DeepSeek V4 stops being the automatic cheap answer on August 16, when prices rise 3x to 12x and move to peak and off-peak billing. Full breakdown in [Model Taxonomy](02-model-landscape/01-model-taxonomy.md).

## 🎯 What This Guide Is (and Is Not)

**This guide IS:**
- A staff-level reference for designing production AI systems (RAG, agents, MCP, eval pipelines, multi-tenant isolation).
- An interview-prep companion with 128 real questions, answer frameworks with a worked mock transcript, and nine whiteboard exercises through August 2026.
- A living document tracking new model releases, protocol changes, and emerging patterns as they ship.
- Opinionated about tradeoffs: latency vs cost, accuracy vs faithfulness, single-agent vs multi-agent.
- Free, MIT-licensed, and open to PRs from practitioners.

**This guide is NOT:**
- A tutorial on Python, PyTorch, or basic ML fundamentals (start with a course; see [COURSES.md](COURSES.md)).
- A vendor-neutral hedge; it names specific models, prices, and frameworks because real systems require real choices.
- A replacement for hands-on building; read it alongside a project, not instead of one.
- A research paper digest; it cites papers when they change practice, not for completeness.

- Building LLM judges with Train/Dev/Test split and ground truth calibration
- Code-based evaluators (regex, JSON schema, format validators)
- RAG-specific evals: faithfulness, context recall, answer relevance
- Multi-step pipeline evaluation and multi-turn conversation eval
- Production guardrails, safety monitoring, real-time drift detection
- Statistical correction with `judgy` library
- Human annotation best practices and inter-rater reliability
- Cost/latency optimization for eval pipelines at scale

## 🎓 For Interview Prep

AI engineering and system design interviews ask questions like:

> "Design a multi-tenant RAG system where competitors cannot see each other's data."

> "Your agent takes 15 steps for a 3-step task. How do you debug it?"

This guide gives you **concrete patterns**, **real tradeoffs**, and **production failure modes**: the depth interviewers expect at senior levels.

➡️ Start with [Interview Prep](00-interview-prep/)

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### What is AI system design?
AI system design is the discipline of architecting production-grade systems built around LLMs, retrieval, agents, and evaluation. It covers model selection, RAG pipelines, agent orchestration, memory, observability, and safety. See [LLM Internals](01-foundations/01-llm-internals.md) and [AI Design Patterns](15-ai-design-patterns/) to get oriented.

### How do I prepare for an AI engineering interview?
Start with the [Question Bank](00-interview-prep/01-question-bank.md) (128 questions through August 2026), then practice with [Answer Frameworks](00-interview-prep/02-answer-frameworks.md) and [Whiteboard Exercises](00-interview-prep/04-whiteboard-exercises.md). Most senior interviews test RAG design, agent debugging, multi-tenant isolation, and cost/latency tradeoffs, all covered in the [Case Studies](16-case-studies/).

### What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?
RAG is a pattern where an LLM retrieves relevant context from an external knowledge source (vector DB, search index, graph) before generating an answer, reducing hallucinations and grounding responses in your data. The full pipeline is covered in [RAG Fundamentals](06-retrieval-systems/01-rag-fundamentals.md) and scaled in [Production RAG at Scale](06-retrieval-systems/14-production-rag-at-scale.md).

### What are AI agents and how are they different from chatbots?
AI agents are LLM-driven systems that plan, call tools, and act over multiple steps to accomplish goals, whereas chatbots typically respond in a single turn. Agents introduce loops, memory, error recovery, and tool-use via protocols like MCP. Start with [Agent Fundamentals](07-agentic-systems/01-agent-fundamentals.md).

### What is MCP (Model Context Protocol) and how does it compare to A2A?
MCP is an open protocol that lets LLMs discover and call external tools and data sources in a standardized way. A2A (Agent-to-Agent) is a complementary protocol for inter-agent communication. They solve different layers: MCP is the tool boundary, A2A is the agent boundary. See [Tool Use and MCP](07-agentic-systems/03-tool-use-and-mcp.md).

### Which LLM should I use in production: Claude, GPT, Gemini, or open-source?
It depends on latency budget, context length, cost per million tokens, tool-use quality, and data residency. The [Model Taxonomy](02-model-landscape/01-model-taxonomy.md) and [Pricing](02-model-landscape/03-pricing-and-costs.md) chapters give a head-to-head for Claude Opus 5, Claude Sonnet 5, GPT-5.6, Gemini 3.7 Flash, Grok 4.6, DeepSeek V4, and others as of August 2026.

### How do I evaluate an LLM or RAG system in production?
Combine offline evals (LLM-as-a-judge with ground-truth calibration), online metrics (faithfulness, context recall, answer relevance), and continuous tracing. The companion deep-dives [AI Evals: Phoenix + Langfuse](ai_evals_comprehensive_study_guide.md) and [AI Evals: LangWatch + Langfuse](ai_evals_complete_guide_langwatch_langfuse.md) walk through this end-to-end.

### How do I build a multi-tenant RAG system safely?
Use defense-in-depth: per-tenant indexes or namespaces, query-time access checks, and prompt-layer guards. The [Access Control](12-security-and-access/02-access-control.md) chapter and [Multi-Tenant SaaS Case Study](16-case-studies/08-multi-tenant-saas.md) cover the patterns that hold up in interviews and production.

### What is agentic RAG?
Agentic RAG combines retrieval with an agent loop that can decide what to search, when to re-query, and when to escalate, instead of running a single fixed retrieve-then-generate pass. See [Agentic RAG](06-retrieval-systems/08-agentic-rag.md) for the architectures and tradeoffs.

### Is this guide free? Can I contribute?
Yes, MIT-licensed and free. PRs are welcome; see [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md). If you have production failure modes, new model benchmarks, or interview questions to add, open a PR.

### How often is this guide updated?
Continuously. New model releases, protocol changes (MCP, A2A), and emerging patterns are added as they ship. Recent additions include [Tool-Use and Computer Agents](17-tool-use-and-computer-agents/01-tool-use-landscape.md) and the [August 2026 Job Market Trends](00-interview-prep/06-job-market-trends-2026.md).

### Can I use this guide if I am transitioning from backend, QA, PM, or EM into AI?
Yes. The [Role Transition Guide](TRANSITION_GUIDE.md) maps existing skills to AI engineering, MLE, and AI architect tracks, with reading paths per role. Pair it with [COURSES.md](COURSES.md) for curated learning resources.
