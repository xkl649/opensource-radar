# Awesome Harness Engineering [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of articles, playbooks, benchmarks, specifications, and open-source projects for harness engineering: the practice of shaping the environment around AI agents so they can work reliably.

Harness engineering sits at the intersection of context engineering, evaluation, observability, orchestration, safe autonomy, and software architecture. This list focuses on resources that make agents more dependable in real workflows, especially long-running coding and research tasks.

Generic agent tooling is out of scope unless the page directly covers harness design, context management, evaluation, runtime control, or other reliability-critical harness primitives.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

- [How we built our multi-agent research system](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/multi-agent-research-system) - Anthropic's architecture write-up for a multi-agent system with separation of roles and structured coordination.
- [Orkas](https://github.com/Orkas-AI/Orkas) - Local-first desktop harness for coordinating multiple agents with shared files, independent work contexts, human approval gates, and resumable execution.
- [Agentlas OS](https://github.com/agentlas-ai/Agentlas-OS) - Local-first agent operation environment that composes specialist teams while retaining host-local tools, permissions, memory boundaries, and verification rules.
- [Squadron](https://github.com/mlund01/squadron) - MIT-licensed declarative runtime for multi-agent workflows defined in HCL, including orchestration, state, dependency resolution, routing, persistence, and resume.
- [Cowork Forge](https://github.com/sopaco/cowork-forge) - MIT-licensed multi-agent software-development workflow with specialized roles and a staged pipeline from requirements through delivery.

### Browser, MCP & Tool Integration

- [browser-use/browser-harness](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-harness) - A thin CDP-based browser harness that lets agents extend helper functions during execution, useful for inspecting self-healing web-task workflows.
- [Uni-CLI](https://github.com/olo-dot-io/Uni-CLI) - Universal CLI hub connecting agents to 134 sites and desktop apps via 711 declarative YAML pipelines. Ships an 8-phase Karpathy-style self-repair loop, eval harness with a starter catalog, per-call cost ledger, hardcoded sensitive-path deny list, and `unicli mcp serve` that auto-registers one MCP tool per adapter. ~80 tokens per invocation.
- [OpenAgentRelay](https://github.com/ShakespeareLabs/open-agent-relay) - Inspectable runtime boundary for exposing a local agent or automation as a keyed LAN capability with target verification, bounded conversations, JSON output, and explicit exit codes.
- [BrowserAct](https://github.com/browser-act/skills) - Open-source browser automation layer for agents with isolated parallel sessions, multi-account operation, and human handoff when automation is blocked.

### Workflow, Profiles & Asset Management

- [Bring Your AI MCP](https://github.com/unitedideas/bringyour-mcp) - Public harness-migration reference for Claude Code to Codex moves, with installable auditor artifacts and explicit validation notes for hooks, MCP config, and instruction-file differences.
- [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) - A community marketplace for discovering, sharing, and installing reusable AI agent skills across runtimes like Claude Code and OpenClaw, making harness capabilities portable and composable.
- [stelow](https://github.com/calionauta/stelow) - Agentic product-workflow harness with Shape Up boundaries, adversarial plan review, acceptance-based execution contracts, and audit loops.
- [Build A Harness](https://github.com/3IVIS/buildaharness) - Apache-2.0 visual canvas for agent harnesses that compiles a runtime-neutral FlowSpec to several orchestration frameworks.
- [agent-harness](https://github.com/ar27111994/agent-harness) - Reproducible lifecycle for coding-agent assets with authority-ranked discovery, pinned mirrors, quarantine routing, staged activation, and host-specific wiring.
- [codex-profiles](https://github.com/Ducksss/codex-profiles) - Codex CLI and Desktop profile launcher that isolates authentication, configuration, sessions, connectors, plugins, and logs by `CODEX_HOME`.
- [AgentPlane](https://github.com/basilisk-labs/agentplane) - Git-native workflow-control harness that stores task records, policy, verification evidence, and closure state as reviewable repository artifacts.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please prefer resources that are:

- Specific about how agents are constrained, evaluated, resumed, observed, or orchestrated
- Original implementations, primary-source articles, or high-signal technical write-ups
- Useful to practitioners building real harnesses instead of generic AI commentary

If two links say the same thing, prefer the more primary, practical, and implementation-oriented one.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution guidelines and the preferred entry format.
