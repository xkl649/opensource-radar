## What is Neuron?

Neuron is a PHP framework for creating and orchestrating AI Agents. It allows you to integrate AI entities into your
PHP applications with a powerful and flexible architecture. We provide tools for the entire agentic application development lifecycle,
from LLM interfaces, data loading, multi-agent orchestration, to monitoring and debugging.
In addition, we provide tutorials and other educational content to help you get started using AI Agents in your projects.

## Why Neuron

Your next application will be agentic. A growing share of new software is no longer a web application with AI features added along the way, but an application born agentic, where the agent is the architecture itself, driving how the system reasons, acts, and talks to its interface. Building this kind of application requires a specific set of foundations: event-driven workflows with checkpointing, human-in-the-loop interruption, multi-agent orchestration, streaming through agentic UI protocols like AG-UI and the Vercel AI SDK protocol, MCP, and asynchronous execution.

In the PHP ecosystem, this set of foundations exists in one place. Each one is a chapter of the documentation:
[Workflow](#workflow),
[Human in the loop](https://docs.neuron-ai.dev/workflow/human-in-the-loop),
[Streaming & UI protocols](https://docs.neuron-ai.dev/agent/streaming#stream-adapters),
[MCP](#mcp-connector),
[Async](https://docs.neuron-ai.dev/agent/async).
You can compare it with any other option available to a PHP developer, and the comparison is the answer.

There is also no second framework waiting for you when the project grows. The same Workflow that runs your first agent in the getting started guide runs a multi-agent system with state, loops, and human approvals in production. What you learn on day one is what you ship in future projects.

## A Vertical & Independent Ecosystem

Neuron is also the only vertical ecosystem for agentic applications development in PHP. Around the framework there is a registry of extensions, tools, and technologies designed specifically for agentic applications, and a growing number of companies building on the same architecture instead of assembling their own from scattered parts.

For a software house, this is a place to be recognized as a specialist rather than one more team claiming AI experience. For a company that needs an agentic foundation it can commit to for years, it means standardizing on an architecture whose whole direction is this space, not a general-purpose library where agents are a side feature.

## Install

Install the latest version via composer:

```
composer require neuron-core/neuron-ai
```

<a name="create">

## Create an Agent

Neuron provides you with the Agent class you can extend to inherit the main features of the framework
and create fully functional agents. This class automatically manages some advanced mechanisms for you, such as memory,
tools, and function calls, up to RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation). You can go deeper into these aspects in the [documentation](https://docs.neuron-ai.dev).

Let's create an Agent with the command below:

```
vendor/bin/neuron make:agent DataAnalystAgent
```

```php
<?php

namespace App\Neuron;

use NeuronAI\Agent\Agent;
use NeuronAI\Agent\SystemPrompt;
use NeuronAI\Providers\AIProviderInterface;
use NeuronAI\Providers\Anthropic\Anthropic;

class DataAnalystAgent extends Agent
{
    protected function provider(): AIProviderInterface
    {
        return new Anthropic(
            key: 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY',
            model: 'ANTHROPIC_MODEL',
        );
    }

    protected function instructions(): string
    {
        return (string) new SystemPrompt(
            background: [
                "You are a data analyst expert in creating reports from SQL databases."
            ]
        );
    }
}
```

The `SystemPrompt` class is designed to take your base instructions and build a consistent prompt for the underlying model
reducing the effort for prompt engineering.

<a name="talk">

## Talk to the Agent

Send a message to the agent to get a response from the underlying LLM:

```php

$agent = DataAnalystAgent::make();


$response = $agent->chat(
    new UserMessage("Hi, I'm Valerio. Who are you?")
)->getMessage();
echo $response->getContent();
// I'm a data analyst. How can I help you today?


$response = $agent->chat(
    new UserMessage("Do you remember my name?")
)->getMessage();
echo $response->getContent();
// Your name is Valerio, as you said in your introduction.
```

As you can see in the example above, the Agent has memory of the ongoing conversation. Learn more about memory in the [documentation](https://docs.neuron-ai.dev/agent/chat-history-and-memory).

<a name="monitoring">

## Monitoring & Debugging

Integrating AI Agents into your application, you’re not working only with functions and deterministic code,
you program your agent influencing probability distributions. Same input ≠ output.
That means reproducibility, versioning, and debugging become real problems.

Many of the Agents you build with Neuron will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls,
tool usage, access to external memories, etc. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial
to be able to inspect what exactly your agent is doing and why.

Why is the model taking certain decisions? What data is the model reacting to? Prompting is not programming
in the common sense. No static types, small changes break output, long prompts cost latency,
and no two models behave exactly the same with the same prompt.

The best way to take your AI application under control is with [Inspector](https://inspector.dev). After you sign up,
make sure to set the `INSPECTOR_INGESTION_KEY` variable in the application environment file to start monitoring:

```dotenv
INSPECTOR_INGESTION_KEY=fwe45gtxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

After configuring the environment variable, you will see the agent execution timeline in your Inspector dashboard.

<a name="tools">

## Tools & Toolkits

Make your agent able to perform concrete tasks, like reading from a database, by adding tools or toolkits (collections of tools).

```php
<?php

namespace App\Neuron;

use NeuronAI\Agent\Agent;
use NeuronAI\Providers\AIProviderInterface;
use NeuronAI\Providers\Anthropic\Anthropic;
use NeuronAI\Agent\SystemPrompt;
use NeuronAI\Tools\ToolProperty;
use NeuronAI\Tools\Tool;
use NeuronAI\Tools\Toolkits\MySQL\MySQLToolkit;

class DataAnalystAgent extends Agent
{
    protected function provider(): AIProviderInterface
    {
        return new Anthropic(
            key: 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY',
            model: 'ANTHROPIC_MODEL',
        );
    }

    protected function instructions(): string
    {
        return (string) new SystemPrompt(
            background: [
                "You are a data analyst expert in creating reports from SQL databases."
            ]
        );
    }

    protected function tools(): array
    {
        return [
            MySQLToolkit::make(
                \DB::connection()->getPdo()
            ),
        ];
    }
}
```

Ask the agent something about your database:

```php
$response = DataAnalystAgent::make()->chat(
    new UserMessage("How many orders we received today?")
)->getMessage();

echo $response->getContent();
```

Learn more about Tools in the [documentation](https://docs.neuron-ai.dev/agent/tools).

<a name="mcp">

## MCP Connector

Instead of implementing tools manually, you can connect tools exposed by an MCP server with the `McpConnector` component:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Neuron;

use NeuronAI\Agent\Agent;
use NeuronAI\MCP\McpConnector;
use NeuronAI\Providers\AIProviderInterface;
use NeuronAI\Providers\Anthropic\Anthropic;
use NeuronAI\Tools\ToolProperty;
use NeuronAI\Tools\Tool;

class DataAnalystAgent extends Agent
{
    protected function provider(): AIProviderInterface
    {
        ...
    }

    protected function instructions(): string
    {
        ...
    }

    protected function tools(): array
    {
        return [
            // Connect to an MCP server
            ...McpConnector::make([
                'command' => 'npx',
                'args' => ['-y', '@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything'],
            ])->tools(),
        ];
    }
}
```

Learn more about MCP connector in the [documentation](https://docs.neuron-ai.dev/agent/mcp-connector).

<a name="structured">

## Structured Output
There are scenarios where you need Agents to understand natural language, but output in a structured format, like
business processes automation, data extraction, etc. to use the output with other downstream systems.

```php
use App\Neuron\MyAgent;
use NeuronAI\Chat\Messages\UserMessage;
use NeuronAI\StructuredOutput\SchemaProperty;

/*
 * Define the output structure as a PHP class.
 */
class Person
{
    #[SchemaProperty(
        description: 'The user name',
        required: true
    )]
    public string $name;

    #[SchemaProperty(
        description: 'What the user love to eat'
    )]
    public string $preference;
}

/*
 * Talk to the agent requiring the structured output
 */
$person = MyAgent::make()->structured(
    new UserMessage("I'm John and I like pizza!"),
    Person::class
);

echo $person->name ' like '.$person->preference;
// John like pizza
```

Learn more about Structured Output on the [documentation](https://docs.neuron-ai.dev/agent/structured-output).

<a name="rag">

## RAG

To create a RAG, you need to attach some additional components other than the AI provider, such as a `vector store`,
and an `embeddings provider`.

Let's create a RAG with the command below:

```
vendor/bin/neuron make:rag MyChatBot
```

Here is an example of a RAG implementation:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Neuron;

use NeuronAI\Providers\AIProviderInterface;
use NeuronAI\Providers\Anthropic\Anthropic;
use NeuronAI\RAG\Embeddings\EmbeddingsProviderInterface;
use NeuronAI\RAG\Embeddings\VoyageEmbeddingProvider;
use NeuronAI\RAG\RAG;
use NeuronAI\RAG\VectorStore\PineconeVectorStore;
use NeuronAI\RAG\VectorStore\VectorStoreInterface;

class MyChatBot extends RAG
{
    protected function provider(): AIProviderInterface
    {
        return new Anthropic(
            key: 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY',
            model: 'ANTHROPIC_MODEL',
        );
    }

    protected function embeddings(): EmbeddingsProviderInterface
    {
        return new VoyageEmbeddingProvider(
            key: 'VOYAGE_API_KEY',
            model: 'VOYAGE_MODEL'
        );
    }

    protected function vectorStore(): VectorStoreInterface
    {
        return new PineconeVectorStore(
            key: 'PINECONE_API_KEY',
            indexUrl: 'PINECONE_INDEX_URL'
        );
    }
}
```

Learn more about RAG in the [documentation](https://docs.neuron-ai.dev/rag/rag).

<a name="workflow">

## Workflow
Think of a Workflow as a smart flowchart for your AI applications. The idea behind Workflow is to allow developers
to use all the Neuron components like AI providers, embeddings, data loaders, chat history, vector store, etc.,
as standalone components to create totally customized agentic systems.

Agent and RAG classes represent a ready to use implementation of the most common patterns when it comes
to retrieval use cases, or tool calls, structured output, etc. Workflow allows you to program your
agentic system completely from scratch. Agent and RAG can be used inside a Workflow to complete tasks
as any other component if you need their built-in capabilities.

[![Neuron Workflow](./docs/images/workflow.png)](https://docs.neuron-ai.dev/v2/workflow/getting-started)

Neuron Workflow supports a robust [**human-in-the-loop**](https://docs.neuron-ai.dev/workflow/human-in-the-loop)
pattern, enabling human intervention at any point in an automated process. This is especially useful in
large language model (LLM)-driven applications where model output may require validation, correction,
or additional context to complete the task.

Learn more about Workflow on the [documentation](https://docs.neuron-ai.dev/workflow/getting-started).

## AI Assisted Development

When working with AI coding assistants like Claude Code, Opencode, Cursor, or other similar tools, you
have two options to give the AI deep context about Neuron components. This leads to more accurate code suggestions,
better understanding of component APIs, and fewer hallucinations when generating Neuron code:

- [Skills](https://docs.neuron-ai.dev/overview/agentic-development#agent-skills)
- [MCP server](https://docs.neuron-ai.dev/overview/agentic-development#mcp-server)
