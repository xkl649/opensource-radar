Never heard of "agent skills" before? You're in the right place. This is a community-curated list of simple text files that teach AI assistants (like Claude, Copilot, or Codex) how to do new things on demand, without retraining. Unlike bulk-generated skill repositories, this collection focuses on real-world Agent Skills created and used by actual engineering teams. Compatible with Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity, Gemini CLI, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, and more.

## Quick Start (30 seconds)

**Step 1: Pick a skill** from the directory below (or browse at [agent-skill.co](https://agent-skill.co))

**Step 2: Load it into your AI agent:**
- Claude Code: `/skills add <github-url>`
- Claude.ai: paste the raw SKILL.md URL in a new conversation
- Codex / Copilot: follow platform docs linked in [Using Skills](#using-skills)

**Step 3: Ask your AI to use it.** Just describe what you want in plain English.

That's it. No installation. No configuration. No coding required.

## What Are Agent Skills?

Think of **Agent Skills** as "how-to guides" for AI assistants. Instead of the AI needing to know everything upfront, skills let it learn new abilities on the fly, like giving someone a recipe card instead of making them memorize an entire cookbook.

Skills are simple text files (called `SKILL.md`) that teach an AI how to do specific tasks. When you ask the AI to do something, it finds the right skill, reads the instructions, and gets to work.

### How It Works

Skills load in three stages:

1. **Browse**: The AI sees a list of available skills (just names and short descriptions)
2. **Load**: When a skill is needed, the AI reads the full instructions
3. **Use**: The AI follows the instructions and accesses any helper files

### Why This Matters

- **Faster and lighter**: The AI only loads what it needs, when it needs it
- **Works everywhere**: Create a skill once, use it with any compatible AI tool
- **Easy to share**: Skills are just files you can copy, download, or share on GitHub

Skills are **instructions**, not code. The AI reads them like a human would read a guide, then follows the steps.

## How to Find Skills (Recommended)

### SkillsMP Marketplace

[![SkillsMP Marketplace](assets/skills-mp.png)](https://skillsmp.com)

It is recommended to use the **[SkillsMP Marketplace](https://skillsmp.com)**, which automatically indexes all Skill projects on GitHub and organizes them by category, update time, star count, and other tags — making it the easiest way to discover and evaluate skills.

### skills.sh Leaderboard by Vercel

[![skills.sh Leaderboard](assets/skills-sh.png)](https://skills.sh)

You can also use **[skills.sh](https://skills.sh)** — Vercel's leaderboard — to intuitively view the most popular Skills repositories and individual Skill usage statistics.

### npx skills CLI Tool

For specific skills, use the `npx skills` command-line tool to quickly discover, add, and manage skills. For detailed parameters, see [vercel-labs/skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills).

```bash
npx skills find [query]            # Search for related skills
npx skills add <owner/repo>        # Install skills (supports GitHub shorthand, full URL, local path)
npx skills list                    # List installed skills
npx skills check                   # Check for available updates
npx skills update                  # Upgrade all skills
npx skills remove [skill-name]     # Uninstall skills
```

---

## Using Skills

### Using Skills in Claude.ai
1. Click the skill icon in your chat interface.
2. Add skills from the marketplace or upload custom skills.
3. Claude automatically activates relevant skills based on your task.

### Using Skills in Google Antigravity

Antigravity supports two types of skills:

- **Workspace Skills**: Project-specific skills located in `/.agent/skills/`
- **Global Skills**: User-wide skills located in `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills`

For more details, see the [official documentation](https://antigravity.google/docs/skills).

### Using Skills in Claude Code

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r skill-name ~/.claude/skills/
```

Verify skill metadata:
```bash
head ~/.claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md
```

The skill loads automatically and activates when relevant.

### Using Skills in Codex

Use the built-in `$skill-creator` skill in Codex. Or install manually:

```bash
$skill-installer linear
```

Restart Codex after installing a skill to pick it up.

### Using Skills in VS Code / GitHub Copilot

Skills are stored in directories with a `SKILL.md` file:

- `.github/skills/` — Recommended location for all new skills
- `.claude/skills/` — Legacy location, also supported

**SKILL.md structure:**
- `name` (required): A unique lowercase identifier using hyphens for spaces
- `description` (required): What the skill does and when the agent should use it
- Markdown body with instructions, examples, and guidelines

### Using MCP Servers (Claude Desktop)

Edit your configuration file:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/username/Desktop"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Creating Skills

Skills are instruction bundles that tell the agent how to perform specific tasks. They are not executable code.

### Skill Structure

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          # Required: Instructions and metadata
├── scripts/          # Optional: Helper scripts
├── templates/        # Optional: Document templates
└── resources/        # Optional: Reference files
```

### Basic SKILL.md Template

```markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description: A clear description of what this skill does.
---

# My Skill Name

Detailed description of the skill's purpose.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use case 1
- Use case 2

## Instructions

[Detailed instructions for the agent on how to execute this skill]

## Examples

[Real-world examples]
```

### MCP Server Example (Python)

For skills that need to connect to external data sources:

```bash
pip install fastmcp
```

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("My Server")

@mcp.tool()
def hello_world(name: str = "World") -> str:
    """A simple tool that says hello."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

## Trends & Capabilities (2026)

The AI agent ecosystem has dramatically shifted from reactive chat interfaces to **autonomous, goal-driven systems** executing end-to-end multi-step workflows — a period often called the "Agent Leap."

### 1. Autonomous Execution

Modern agents move past simple "prompt-response" models. They break down broad objectives into multi-step strategic plans, weighing trade-offs and executing sequences independently.

### 2. Multi-Agent Orchestration

Complex tasks are managed by specialized agent teams (documentation, testing, coding) coordinated by "manager" agents that synthesize deliverables and resolve conflicts.

### 3. Agentic IDEs

Environments like Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, and GitHub Copilot have evolved into full "Agentic IDEs" where agents execute terminal commands, monitor telemetry, and manage files natively via MCP and direct filesystem access.

### 4. Domain-Specific Skills at Scale

Organizations are moving from general-purpose prompting to highly specialized skills for each platform and workflow — reducing hallucinations and improving reliability in production deployments.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are Agent Skills?

Agent Skills are instruction files that teach AI assistants how to do specific tasks. They only load when needed, so the AI stays fast and focused.

### How are Agent Skills different from fine-tuning?

Fine-tuning permanently changes how an AI thinks (expensive and hard to update). Agent Skills are just instruction files — you can update, swap, or share them anytime without touching the AI itself.

### What's the difference between Agent Skills and MCP?

They work great together:
- **Agent Skills** — teach the AI *how* to do something (workflows, best practices)
- **MCP** — help the AI *access* things (APIs, databases, external tools)

### Which AI tools support Agent Skills?

Currently supported: **Claude** (Claude.ai and Claude Code), **GitHub Copilot**, **VS Code**, **Codex** (OpenAI), **Antigravity** (Google), **Gemini CLI**, **Kiro**, and **Junie**. The ecosystem is growing rapidly.

### Do Agent Skills run code?

No. Skills are just text instructions — the AI reads and follows them like a recipe. If you need to run actual code, you'd use MCP servers alongside skills.

### How do I create my first Agent Skill?

1. Create a `SKILL.md` file with a name and description at the top
2. Write clear, step-by-step instructions in the file
3. Put it in your `.github/skills/` or `.claude/skills/` folder
4. Test it out!

Full guide: [How to create custom skills](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512198-creating-custom-skills)

### I'm not a developer — can I still use skills?

Yes. Skills are plain-English instruction files, not code. You need an AI assistant (like Claude.ai) and nothing else. No terminal, no GitHub account, no technical background required. Just paste a skill's URL into your AI chat and start using it.

### Are skills free?

Skills themselves are free text files — you can download and use any skill in this list at no cost. You do need an AI subscription (e.g., Claude Pro, GitHub Copilot) to run them, since skills are read and followed by the AI.

### How do I know if a skill is safe to use?

Every skill in this list is a public GitHub repository — you can read the full instructions before loading anything. Check the repo's stars, last update date, and README. Skills are plain text: there's no executable code that can run on your machine.
