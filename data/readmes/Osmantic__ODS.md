ODS installs and wires together everything you need to run AI locally, so you do not have to assemble Ollama, Open WebUI, n8n, ComfyUI, and privacy tools by hand:

- **Local model inference** — run open models on your own hardware
- **ChatGPT-style web UI** — talk to your models from any browser
- **Control dashboard** — manage models, services, setup, GPU status, and extensions from one place
- **Voice, agents, and workflows** — build automations that can listen, speak, call tools, and get work done
- **RAG and search** — connect local documents, private search, and retrieval workflows
- **Image generation** — run local image tools without sending prompts to a hosted API
- **Privacy and ops** — keep service auth, secrets, observability, and diagnostics in one local stack

No cloud required. No subscriptions required. Your prompts and data stay on your machine unless you choose otherwise. Cloud and hybrid API modes are optional when you want them.

**Release validation:** Operational changes are checked with a release-grade
fleet and distro lab: zero-prereq bootstrap, fresh installs, product flows,
full-model capabilities, lifecycle recovery, and the final User Green gate. See
[Release Validation](ods/docs/RELEASE_VALIDATION.md) for what a green
run proves.

**Repo layout:** the repository root holds the public README, installers,
security policy, GitHub workflows, and project coordination docs. The
`ods/` directory is the product runtime: services, installer phases,
compose overlays, dashboard, CLI, tests, and operator docs.

**Stable consumption:** `v2.6.0` is the current stable release. `main` moves
quickly; use it for active development and validation candidates. For forks,
appliances, labs, or production-like installs, pin a tagged release or audited
commit and keep your own validation receipt. Stable patch fixes land on
`release/2.6.x` before being merged forward. See
[Release Channels](ods/docs/RELEASE_CHANNELS.md),
[Installer Trust](ods/docs/INSTALLER_TRUST.md), and
[Forkability](ods/docs/FORKABILITY.md).

## Get Started

Choose your system, copy the block, run it in a normal terminal. ODS installs the stack, picks a model for your hardware, starts the services, and gives you the local web UI.

**Linux or macOS**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.osmantic.com/ods.sh | bash
```

**Windows PowerShell**

```powershell
$ProgressPreference = "SilentlyContinue"
$odsSrc = Join-Path $env:TEMP ("ods-install-" + [guid]::NewGuid().ToString("N"))
$odsZip = Join-Path $odsSrc "ods-main.zip"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $odsSrc | Out-Null
Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/Osmantic/ODS/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" -OutFile $odsZip
Expand-Archive -LiteralPath $odsZip -DestinationPath $odsSrc -Force
cd (Get-ChildItem -LiteralPath $odsSrc -Directory | Select-Object -First 1).FullName
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\install.ps1
```

Prerequisites: Docker must be installed and running. On Windows, use Docker Desktop with the WSL2 backend enabled and run the block in a normal, non-Administrator PowerShell window.

The hosted Linux/macOS endpoint proxies the current bootstrap from repository `main`.
Reviewed merges reach it automatically after edge-cache refresh. `ODS_REF` selects a compatible repository checkout. See
[Installer Trust](ods/docs/INSTALLER_TRUST.md) to inspect the script or install
a stable release or audited commit manually.

Windows users should not run the `curl ... | bash` command from PowerShell. The PowerShell block above downloads the source ZIP and runs the same Windows installer used by the clone-based workflow. For more detail, see the [Windows Quickstart](ods/docs/WINDOWS-QUICKSTART.md).

After install, open **http://localhost:3000** and start chatting.

Uninstall later with the matching platform command:

```bash
cd ~/ods
./ods-uninstall.sh --force
```

```powershell
$installDir = "$env:USERPROFILE\ods"
cd $installDir
.\ods.ps1 uninstall --force
```

Windows recovery note: if the runtime folder is partial and `.\ods.ps1` is missing, run the same command from a source checkout as `.\ods\installers\windows\ods.ps1 uninstall --force`. It removes Docker resources labelled as the ODS compose project before removing the runtime directory.

> **API endpoint:** Linux Docker installs expose llama-server on **http://localhost:11434** by default (`OLLAMA_PORT`) while containers use `llama-server:8080`. macOS native Metal and Windows native/Lemonade paths use **http://localhost:8080** unless overridden. Open WebUI stays on **http://localhost:3000**.

> **No GPU?** ODS also runs in cloud mode — same full stack, powered by OpenAI/Anthropic/Together APIs instead of local inference:
> ```bash
> ./install.sh --cloud
> ```

> **Port conflicts?** Every port is configurable via environment variables. See [`.env.example`](ods/.env.example) for the full list, or override at install time:
> ```bash
> WEBUI_PORT=9090 ./install.sh
> ```

## Why ODS?

A handful of companies control the vast majority of global AI traffic — and with it, your data, your costs, and your uptime. Every query you send to a centralized provider is business intelligence you don’t own, running on infrastructure you don’t control, priced on terms you can’t negotiate.

If AI is becoming critical infrastructure, it shouldn’t be rented. Self-hosting local AI should be a sovereign human right, not a career choice.

Because running your own AI shouldn't require a CS degree and a weekend of debugging CUDA drivers. Right now, setting up local AI means stitching together a dozen projects, writing Docker configs from scratch, and praying everything talks to each other. Most people give up and go back to paying OpenAI.

We built ODS so you don't have to.

- **One command** — detects your GPU, picks the right model, generates credentials, launches everything
- **Chatting in under 2 minutes** — bootstrap mode gives you a working model instantly while your full model downloads in the background
- **Full service stack, pre-wired** — chat, agents, voice, workflows, search, RAG, image generation, privacy tools, observability, and developer tools. All talking to each other out of the box
- **Fully moddable** — every service is an extension. Drop in a folder, run `ods enable`, done

<details>
<summary><b>Manual install (Linux)</b></summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Osmantic/ODS.git
cd ODS/ods
./install.sh
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Windows (PowerShell)</b></summary>

Requires [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) with WSL2 backend enabled.
**Install Docker Desktop first and make sure it is running before you start.**

Open a normal **PowerShell** session and run:

```powershell
$ProgressPreference = "SilentlyContinue"
$odsSrc = Join-Path $env:TEMP ("ods-install-" + [guid]::NewGuid().ToString("N"))
$odsZip = Join-Path $odsSrc "ods-main.zip"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $odsSrc | Out-Null
Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/Osmantic/ODS/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" -OutFile $odsZip
Expand-Archive -LiteralPath $odsZip -DestinationPath $odsSrc -Force
cd (Get-ChildItem -LiteralPath $odsSrc -Directory | Select-Object -First 1).FullName
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\install.ps1
```

> The `Set-ExecutionPolicy` command allows the installer script to run in the current session. It does not change your system-wide policy.
> Running as Administrator is not recommended for the installer because user-level paths such as `.opencode`, `data/`, and `.env` can be created with admin-owned permissions.

The installer detects your GPU, picks the right model, generates credentials, starts all services, and creates a Desktop shortcut to the Dashboard. Manage from the runtime directory with `.\ods.ps1 status`; uninstall with `.\ods.ps1 uninstall --force`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>macOS (Apple Silicon)</b></summary>

Requires Apple Silicon (M1+) and [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
**Install Docker Desktop first and make sure it is running before you start.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Osmantic/ODS.git
cd ODS/ods
./install.sh
```

The installer detects your chip, picks the right model for your unified memory, launches llama-server natively with Metal acceleration, and starts all other services in Docker. Manage with `./ods-macos.sh status`.

See the [macOS Quickstart](ods/docs/MACOS-QUICKSTART.md) for details.

---

## Hardware Auto-Detection

The installer detects your GPU and first assigns a deterministic hardware tier. Linux and macOS then run the versioned catalog selector (`ods/scripts/select-model.py`), while Windows uses the PowerShell catalog selector in `ods/installers/windows/lib/tier-map.ps1`; both read `ods/config/model-library.json` to choose the best installable GGUF for the detected memory envelope. The final choice is written to `.env` as `LLM_MODEL`, `GGUF_FILE`, `MAX_CONTEXT`, and `MODEL_RECOMMENDATION_*`.

`MODEL_PROFILE=qwen` is the default non-Gemma catalog profile, so the effective pick can be Qwen, Phi, or DeepSeek depending on what fits best. `MODEL_PROFILE=gemma4` forces Gemma 4 where available, and `MODEL_PROFILE=auto` uses Gemma 4 on NVIDIA, Apple Silicon, and Intel Arc tiers. Override tier selection with `./install.sh --tier 3`; override the model family with `MODEL_PROFILE=gemma4 ./install.sh` or `MODEL_PROFILE=auto ./install.sh`.

When Hermes is enabled, which is the default agent path, installers keep the first-run bootstrap model at a 64K context floor and promote the full local model context to 128K where the selected model supports it. That avoids Hermes's hard 64K minimum while preserving the under-2-minute first chat experience. The examples below are current catalog-selector outputs for common hardware envelopes; exact installs can differ with detected VRAM/RAM, host architecture, existing downloads, or explicit profile overrides. Throughput still needs a local benchmark after first launch.

### NVIDIA

| Tier / envelope | Current default catalog pick | Context | Example hardware |
|------|--------------|---------|--------------|
| 0 / 8 GB CPU fallback | Qwen3.5 2B (Q4_K_M) | 8K | Low-RAM CPU-only |
| 1 / 8 GB discrete VRAM | Qwen3.5 9B (Q4_K_M) | 32K | RTX 4060, RTX 3060 12GB |
| 2 / 12 GB discrete VRAM | Phi-4 14B (Q4_K_M) | 16K | RTX 4070-class cards |
| 3 / 24 GB discrete VRAM | Qwen3.5 27B (Q4_K_M) | 32K | RTX 4090, A6000 |
| 4 / 48 GB discrete VRAM | DeepSeek R1 Distill Llama 70B (Q4_K_M) | 32K | A6000 Ada, L40S |
| NV_ULTRA / 90+ GB amd64 discrete VRAM | Qwen3 Coder Next (Q4_K_M) | 128K | Multi-GPU A100/H100 |
| NV_ULTRA / 90+ GB arm64 unified memory | Qwen3.6 35B-A3B (UD-Q4_K_M) | 128K | DGX Spark / GB10-class hosts |

### AMD Strix Halo (Unified Memory)

| Tier / envelope | Current default catalog pick | Context | Hardware |
|------|--------------|---------|----------|
| SH_COMPACT / 64 GB unified RAM | Qwen3.6 35B-A3B (UD-Q4_K_M) | 128K | Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 (64GB) |
| SH_LARGE / 96 GB unified RAM | DeepSeek R1 Distill Llama 70B (Q4_K_M) | 32K | Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 (96GB) |
| SH_LARGE / 124 GB unified RAM | Qwen3.6 35B-A3B (UD-Q4_K_M) | 128K | Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 (128GB class) |

The selector routes unified-memory hosts away from Qwen3 Coder Next when that model would otherwise be selected, because current repo policy documents correctness issues on those backends.

### Apple Silicon (Unified Memory, Metal)

| Tier / envelope | Current default catalog pick | Context | Example hardware |
|------|--------------|---------|-----------------|
| 0 / 8 GB unified RAM | Phi-4 Mini (Q4_K_M) | 128K | M1/M2 base (8GB) |
| 1 / 16 GB unified RAM | Qwen3.5 9B (Q4_K_M) | 32K | M4 Mac Mini (16GB) |
| 2 / 32 GB unified RAM | Phi-4 14B (Q4_K_M) | 16K | M4 Pro Mac Mini, M3 Max MacBook Pro |
| 3 / 48 GB unified RAM | Qwen3.5 27B (Q4_K_M) | 32K | M4 Pro (48GB), M2 Max (48GB) |
| 4 / 64+ GB unified RAM | Qwen3.6 35B-A3B (UD-Q4_K_M) | 128K | M2 Ultra Mac Studio, M4 Max (64GB+) |

### Intel Arc (Linux, SYCL)

| Tier / envelope | Current default catalog pick | Context | Example hardware |
|------|--------------|---------|------------------|
| ARC_LITE / 6 GB discrete VRAM | Phi-4 Mini (Q4_K_M) | 128K | Arc A380 |
| ARC_LITE / 8 GB discrete VRAM | Qwen3.5 9B (Q4_K_M) | 32K | Arc A750 |
| ARC / 16 GB discrete VRAM | Phi-4 14B (Q4_K_M) | 16K | Arc A770 16GB, newer Arc GPUs |

Gemma 4 profile tiers remain in the installer tier maps: E2B on entry hardware, E4B on midrange hardware, 26B-A4B on pro hardware, and 31B on large/ultra hardware.

---

## Bootstrap Mode

No waiting for large downloads. ODS uses bootstrap mode by default:

1. Downloads a tiny 1.5B model in under a minute
2. You start chatting immediately
3. The full model downloads in the background
4. Hot-swap to the full model when it's ready — zero downtime

The bootstrap model starts with a 64K context window so Hermes can work during the first session. After the background download finishes, ODS swaps to the full model and restores the Hermes/full-model context target.

Skip bootstrap: `./install.sh --no-bootstrap`

---

## Switching Models

The installer picks a model for your hardware, but you can switch anytime:

```bash
ods model current              # What's running now?
ods model list                 # Show all available tiers
ods model swap T3              # Switch to a different tier
```

If the new model isn't downloaded yet, pre-fetch it first:

```bash
./scripts/pre-download.sh --tier 3    # Download before switching
ods model swap T3                    # Then swap (restarts llama-server)
```

Already have a GGUF you want to use? Drop the single `.gguf` file in
`data/models/`, then open Dashboard -> Models and load the local entry. For
older installs or headless maintenance, update `GGUF_FILE` and `LLM_MODEL` in
`.env`, then restart with the CLI:

```bash
ods restart llm
```

Or restart the container directly from the installed `ods` directory:

```bash
docker compose restart llama-server
```

Rollback is automatic — if a new model fails to load, ODS reverts to your previous model.

---

## Extensibility

ODS is designed to be modded. Every service is an extension — a folder with a `manifest.yaml` and a `compose.yaml`. The dashboard, CLI, health checks, and compose stack all discover extensions automatically.

```
extensions/services/
  my-service/
    manifest.yaml      # Metadata: name, port, health endpoint, GPU backends
    compose.yaml       # Docker Compose fragment (auto-merged into the stack)
```

```bash
ods enable my-service     # Enable it
ods disable my-service    # Disable it
ods list                  # See everything
```

The installer itself is modular — 19 library modules, a shared service registry, and 13 ordered phases. Want to add a hardware tier, swap a default model, or skip a phase? Start with the installer architecture map so you update the Linux, macOS, Windows, upgrade, and host-agent writers together.

[Full extension guide](ods/docs/EXTENSIONS.md) | [Installer architecture](ods/docs/INSTALLER-ARCHITECTURE.md)

---

## ods-cli

The `ods` CLI manages your entire stack:

```bash
ods status                # Health checks + GPU status
ods list                  # All services and their state
ods logs llm              # Tail logs (aliases: llm, stt, tts)
ods restart [service]     # Restart one or all services
ods start / stop          # Start or stop the stack

ods mode cloud            # Switch to cloud APIs via LiteLLM
ods mode local            # Switch back to local inference
ods mode hybrid           # Local primary, cloud fallback

ods model swap T3         # Switch to a different hardware tier
ods enable n8n            # Enable an extension
ods disable whisper       # Disable one

ods config show           # View .env (secrets masked)
ods preset save gaming    # Snapshot current config
ods preset load gaming    # Restore it
```
