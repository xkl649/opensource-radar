CosmoEdge goes beyond model serving with a complete application layer for model import, visual orchestration, alarms, and event delivery. The core engine and console in this repository are released under Apache-2.0; certified hardware, commercial preset models, and Model Guard distribution protection have separate boundaries.

## CosmoEdge 1.1

- **Multi-platform release:** BM1688, CV186X, RK3576, and RV1126B use the same video-ingest, orchestration, event, and observability workflow with target-specific model artifacts.
- **Public benchmark pack:** the [CosmoEdge 1.1 multi-platform report](docs/benchmarks/scenario-bench/v1.1/README.md) covers single workloads, concurrent mixed workloads, and conservative VLM performance display boundaries with sanitized reproducibility attachments.
- **Rockchip release platforms:** RK3576 and RV1126B both include cross-build, board operation, RKNN inference, and MPP/RGA media paths and share the same v1.1 release tier. Their platform-specific benchmark and long-running evidence remain separately traceable without changing that release tier.
- **Sophon model handling:** chip-aware validation supports target-specific `.nn` artifacts for BM1688 and CV186X. The benchmark records an exact Open-package and running-engine binding for both reference devices.
- **RKNN data path:** targeted DMA-BUF-to-RGA input, persistent bound-input, native quantized output, and direct YOLOv8 tensor decoding paths with explicit fallbacks.
- **Agent-assisted development:** a repository-guided path for handing model porting, integration, and UI tasks to the coding agent you already use and receiving verifiable deliverables.
- **Model Guard 2.3:** protects commercial preset-model distribution in Sophon Protected packages. Open and Protected expose the same application features, with no SKU-gated software functionality; they differ in model encryption and device-provisioning tooling.
- **macOS Docker Preview:** an isolated `linux/amd64` path for one local-video workflow on Apple Silicon, validated through multiple end-to-end lab rounds. It remains Preview because it does not enable Model Guard, provide a native macOS/NPU path, cover multi-channel deployment, or represent production performance.
- **Qualification boundary:** VLM raw runs remain short-run observations, while the public matrix applies one conservative 80% performance reference without rewriting the executed gates. Long-running validation continues independently and is not substituted by a capacity staircase.

## Choose a Platform

CosmoEdge provides one engine architecture and orchestration experience, but each build selects one inference backend and uses models generated for that target platform.

| Platform | Status | Runtime / model artifact | Current scope and evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sophon BM1688 | v1.1 supported / primary | BMRT / `.nn` | Production deployment path with [v1.1 workload evidence](docs/benchmarks/scenario-bench/v1.1/README.md) |
| Rockchip RK3576 / RV1126B | v1.1 supported | RKNN / target-specific `.rknn` | Both platforms share the same v1.1 release tier after cross-build, board, media, inference, and end-to-end validation; platform-specific measured results remain separate in the [v1.1 report](docs/benchmarks/scenario-bench/v1.1/README.md) |
| Sophon CV186X | v1.1 supported | BMRT / target-specific `.nn` | Model import and device workload evidence included in the [v1.1 benchmark](docs/benchmarks/scenario-bench/v1.1/README.md) |
| x86 Linux / Windows; Apple Silicon macOS | Linux / Windows supported; macOS Preview | ONNX Runtime / `.onnx` | Mac uses amd64 emulation for one local-video developer workflow, not native performance evidence |
| Sophon BM1684X | Planned | — | Not part of the current release scope |

## Quick Start

### Try locally on x86

No edge hardware is required. The x86 mode uses the same UI and workflow with lower throughput than an NPU deployment.

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/cosmo-wander-ai/cosmo-edge.git
cd cosmo-edge

# 2. Start on Linux
sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.x86.yml up -d --build
# Windows: docker compose -f docker-compose.x86.windows.yml up -d --build

# 3. Open http://localhost:8080
```

Apple Silicon macOS uses a separate amd64-emulation Preview path:

```bash
./scripts/macos-docker-preview.sh doctor
./scripts/macos-docker-preview.sh up
./scripts/macos-docker-preview.sh status
# Open http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

The Mac Preview is for local, single-video evaluation. It is not a native macOS
binary, an NPU deployment, or production performance evidence. Read the full
[macOS Docker Preview](docs/en/guide/macos-docker-preview.md) boundaries first.

After startup, use the [Scenario Configuration tutorial](https://www.cosmowander.ai/docs/tutorials/02-scenario-config/scenario-config) to create your first AI detection task. Docker Compose V1 users can replace `docker compose` with `docker-compose`.

### Build for Sophon

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cosmo-wander-ai/cosmo-edge.git
cd cosmo-edge
# BM1688 (default when the chip model is omitted)
./scripts/docker-compose.sh -f docker-compose.sophon.yml run --rm cosmo-sophon-package --chip bm1688

# CV186X
./scripts/docker-compose.sh -f docker-compose.sophon.yml run --rm cosmo-sophon-package --chip cv186x
```

The wrapper selects the available Compose implementation and requests elevated
Docker access only when required. The build selects the matching model resources
without a model-path argument and exports each target independently under
`build_output/public-runtime/<chip>/`, together with `TARGET_CHIP` and
`SHA256SUMS`.

The default Open package contains plaintext models and requires no device
authorization. Verify the chip marker and checksum before deployment. The
[Build Guide](https://www.cosmowander.ai/docs/guide/build) is the authoritative
build reference; follow the [Deployment Guide](https://www.cosmowander.ai/docs/guide/deployment)
for SSH installation, web upgrade, recovery, and post-reboot acceptance.

### Build for Rockchip

```bash
./scripts/docker-compose.sh -f docker-compose.rockchip.yml pull cosmo-rockchip-package

# RK3576 (uses the tracked RK3576 model resources)
COSMO_TARGET_CHIP=rk3576 ./scripts/docker-compose.sh \
  -f docker-compose.rockchip.yml run --rm cosmo-rockchip-package
ls -lh build_output/rk3576/

# RV1126B (requires a prepared target model overlay)
COSMO_TARGET_CHIP=rv1126b ./scripts/docker-compose.sh \
  -f docker-compose.rockchip.yml run --rm cosmo-rockchip-package
ls -lh build_output/rv1126b/
```

One digest-pinned Rockchip builder shares the compiler and RKNN SDK while
selecting an isolated MPP/RGA profile for each chip. RKLLM v1.3.0 is required
and packaged only for RK3576. Target markers, media-profile identities, and
checksums are exported under `build_output/<chip>/`. See the
[Build Guide](docs/en/guide/build.md#rockchip-artifacts) and
[RK3576 integration guide](docs/en/guide/rk3576-rknn-development.md) for model
and device-validation boundaries.

For CV186X, follow the [CV186X Quick Start](docs/en/guide/cv186x-quick-start.md) for package installation, model import, first-event verification, upgrade, and recovery boundaries.

## What You Can Build

- **Real-time video analytics:** detection, classification, tracking, zones, counters, OSD, and alarm snapshots.
- **Prompt-driven vision:** VLM state judgment and GroundingDINO open-vocabulary detection alongside conventional CV pipelines.
- **Visual application workflows:** connect models, rules, events, and output actions in the browser.
- **Edge integrations:** operate managed tasks and deliver structured events through REST, WebSocket, MQTT, or HTTP webhooks.

## Agent-Assisted Development

Already have a model-porting, integration, or UI task? Give your usual coding agent the business goal, available materials, target device or test environment, and acceptance criteria. The repository provides task entry points, examples, checks, and evidence boundaries so the result can include importable artifacts, scoped code changes, and a verifiable conclusion.

Start with [Agent-Assisted Development](docs/en/development/agent-assisted-development.md), then use the [Model Porting Guide](https://www.cosmowander.ai/docs/tutorials/05-model-porting/model-porting) or [Contributor Guide](docs/en/development/contributing.md) for the task at hand.

## Validation

### CosmoEdge 1.1 multi-platform performance report

The v1.1 report covers BM1688, CV186X, RK3576, and RV1126B. It includes 49 independent small-model case reports for person detection, no-safety-helmet analysis, and a concurrent mixed workload at 5 FPS per business task, plus a conservative VLM performance display matrix.

- [English benchmark index](docs/benchmarks/scenario-bench/v1.1/README.md)
- [中文基准报告索引](docs/benchmarks/scenario-bench/v1.1/README.zh-CN.md)
- [English primary report (rendered documentation site)](https://www.cosmowander.ai/docs/benchmarks/scenario-bench/v1.1/report.html)
- [Methodology and reproduction](docs/benchmarks/scenario-bench/v1.1/methodology.md)

The controlled run uses source commit `89c73a7464a81ef378686447d7c1eeb88b988455`, tree `6857fbcce72c7af64e6cb23a27e66a405e9df9af`, one fixed 1080p24 input, 30-second steps, and the gates recorded in the [release manifest](docs/benchmarks/scenario-bench/v1.1/release-manifest.json).

Each channel concurrently runs two business tasks across three model stages: person detection has one detector stage, while no-safety-helmet analysis has a detector followed by a classifier.

| Platform | Workload per channel | Model stages/ch | Target FPS/task | Passing channels | Business-task bindings |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| BM1688 | Person detection + no-safety-helmet analysis | 3 | 5 | ≥16 | 32/32 |
| CV186X | Person detection + no-safety-helmet analysis | 3 | 5 | ≥8 | 16/16 |
| RK3576 | Person detection + no-safety-helmet analysis | 3 | 5 | ≥8 | 16/16 |
| RV1126B | Person detection + no-safety-helmet analysis | 3 | 5 | ≥4 | 8/8 |

The VLM raw runs did not enable FPS PASS/FAIL. Applying the same conservative publication reference—every active route at or above 80% of the 0.1 FPS target, with a complete non-FPS window—produces:

| Platform | Target FPS/ch | Performance display boundary | Next-step evidence |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| BM1688 | 0.1 | 6 channels | 7-channel minimum was 0.07 FPS |
| CV186X | 0.1 | 6 channels | 7-channel startup-sensitive window excluded |
| RK3576 | 0.1 | 4 channels | 5-channel minimum was 0.07 FPS |
| RV1126B | — | — | No VLM observation in this refresh |

These are short-run display boundaries under the recorded conditions—not exact hardware limits, production recommendations, or long-duration conclusions. See the [v1.1 benchmark](docs/benchmarks/scenario-bench/v1.1/README.md) for the complete matrices. Previously published data remains available through one [v1.0 historical archive](https://www.cosmowander.ai/docs/benchmarks/scenario-bench/v1.0/) link.

+--------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
```

One build selects one inference backend. Model artifacts are generated for the target platform, and feature/model coverage and capacity remain platform-specific. Model Guard Protected distribution currently belongs to the Sophon packaging path.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Can I try CosmoEdge without Sophon or Rockchip hardware?</b></summary>

Yes. Use x86 developer mode on Linux or Windows. Apple Silicon Macs can use the Docker Preview for the console, pipeline, model-management, and integration workflow with one local video. The Mac path uses amd64 emulation and does not enable Model Guard. Edge NPU hardware is still required for target-platform acceleration and capacity validation.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What is the boundary between the Open and Protected packages?</b></summary>

They expose the same application features and use the same MD5 upgrade lifecycle. Open uses plaintext models without device authorization; Sophon Protected packages can carry encrypted commercial preset models and provisioning tooling that require a device-bound certificate. Application archives themselves are not signed.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use my own trained models?</b></summary>

Yes. Use the model-porting path to validate the tensor, preprocessing, post-processing, target runtime, and business accuracy contract. A model artifact must be generated for the platform where it will run.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How production-ready is CosmoEdge?</b></summary>

`v1.1.0` is the multi-platform release line for BM1688, CV186X, RK3576, RV1126B, and x86, with a validated, scoped macOS Docker Preview. The linked report records measured workload boundaries, conservative VLM performance displays, and explicit evidence gaps; long-running qualification remains separate. Production sizing still requires validation with your own models, streams, accuracy requirements, and deployment conditions.
