**Find the best local LLM that actually runs on your hardware.**

Auto-detects your GPU/CPU/RAM and ranks the top models from HuggingFace that fit your system.

[日本語版はこちら](docs/README.ja.md)

## Quick start

Run the recommendation command once, with no project setup.

```bash
uvx whichllm@latest
```

Simulate a GPU before you buy hardware.

```bash
uvx whichllm@latest --gpu "RTX 4090"
```

Install it when you use it often.

```bash
uv tool install whichllm
uv tool upgrade whichllm  # update an existing install
```

Other install paths.

```bash
brew install andyyyy64/whichllm/whichllm
pip install whichllm
```

## Want a safer pick?

By default, whichllm is ambitious. It ranks the best model that looks runnable
on your machine, including partial RAM offload and near-edge VRAM fits when
they seem usable.

If you want a more comfortable LM Studio-style recommendation, start with:

```bash
uvx whichllm@latest --gpu-only --speed usable --vram-headroom 1GB
```

This keeps only models that fit fully in GPU VRAM, filters out slow estimates,
and leaves extra VRAM for runtime overhead.

If LM Studio still says the model is slightly too large, increase the headroom:

```bash
uvx whichllm@latest --gpu-only --speed usable --vram-headroom 1.5GB
```

## Common workflows

After install, run `whichllm` directly. For one-off runs, replace `whichllm`
with `uvx whichllm@latest`.

```bash
# Best models for this machine
whichllm

# Pretend you have a specific GPU
whichllm --gpu "RTX 4090"

# Override detected iGPU/unified-memory limits
whichllm --vram 8 --ram-bandwidth 68

# Only show models that fit fully in GPU VRAM
whichllm --gpu-only
whichllm --fit gpu

# Simulate a multi-GPU workstation
whichllm --gpu "2x RTX 4090"

# Hide models that are technically runnable but too slow
whichllm --speed usable
whichllm --speed fast

# Pasteable GitHub / Slack / Discord output
whichllm --markdown

# Compare upgrade candidates
whichllm upgrade "RTX 4090" "RTX 5090" "H100"

# Find the GPU needed for a model
whichllm plan "llama 3 70b"

# Start a chat with a model
whichllm run "qwen 2.5 1.5b gguf"

# Print copy-paste Python
whichllm snippet "qwen 7b"

# Return JSON for scripts
whichllm --top 1 --json
```

## See it

```text
$ whichllm --gpu "RTX 4090"

#1  Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B     27.8B  Q5_K_M   score 92.8    27 t/s
#2  Qwen/Qwen3-32B       32.0B  Q4_K_M   score 83.0    31 t/s
#3  Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B   30.0B  Q5_K_M   score 82.7   102 t/s
```

The 32B model **fits your card fine** — whichllm still ranks the 27B #1,
because it scores higher on real benchmarks and is a newer generation.
A size-only "what fits?" tool would hand you the bigger one. That gap is
the whole point of whichllm. (Note #3: a MoE model at 102 t/s — speed is
ranked on *active* params, quality on *total*.)

## What can I run?

Real top picks (snapshot 2026-05 — your results track **live** HuggingFace
data, this is not a static list):

| Hardware | VRAM | Top pick | Speed |
|---|---|---|---|
| RTX 5090 | 32 GB | `Qwen3.6-27B` · Q6_K · score 94.7 | ~40 t/s |
| RTX 4090 / 3090 | 24 GB | `Qwen3.6-27B` · Q5_K_M · score 92.8 | ~27 t/s |
| RTX 4060 | 8 GB | `Qwen3-14B` · Q3_K_M · score 71.0 | ~22 t/s |
| Apple M3 Max | 36 GB | `Qwen3.6-27B` · Q5_K_M · score 89.4 | ~9 t/s |
| CPU only | — | `gpt-oss-20b` (MoE) · Q4_K_M · score 45.2 | ~6 t/s |

`whichllm --gpu "<your card>"` simulates any of these before you buy.
By default, rankings include full-GPU, partial-offload, and CPU-only
candidates when they are usable. Use `--gpu-only` or `--fit full-gpu` when
you only want models that fit entirely in GPU VRAM.
The default table shows memory, estimated generation speed, fit type, and
published date. Speed is colored by practical usability: under 4 tok/s is red,
4-10 is yellow, 10-30 is green, and 30+ is bright green. `~` / `?` still mark
estimate confidence.

## Why whichllm?

Fitting a model into your VRAM is the easy part. The hard part is knowing
**which of the models that fit is actually the best** — and that is what
whichllm is built to get right.

- **Evidence-based ranking, not a size heuristic** — The top pick is
  chosen from merged real benchmarks (LiveBench, Artificial Analysis,
  Aider, multimodal/vision, Chatbot Arena ELO, Open LLM Leaderboard) —
  never "the biggest model that happens to fit."
- **Recency-aware** — Stale leaderboards are demoted along each model's
  lineage, so a 2024 model can't outrank a current-generation one on an
  outdated score. The benchmark snapshot date is printed under every
  ranking, so a stale recommendation is self-evident instead of silently
  trusted.
- **Evidence-graded and guarded** — Every score is tagged
  `direct` / `variant` / `base` / `interpolated` / `self-reported` and
  discounted by confidence. Fabricated uploader claims and cross-family
  inheritance (a small fork borrowing its much larger base's score) are
  actively rejected.
- **Architecture-aware estimates** — VRAM = weights + GQA KV cache +
  activation + overhead; speed is bandwidth-bound with per-quant
  efficiency, per-backend factors, MoE active-vs-total split, and
  unified-memory vs discrete-PCIe partial-offload modeling.
- **One command, scriptable** — `whichllm` prints the answer; add
  `--json | jq` for pipelines. No TUI, no keybindings to memorize.
- **Live data** — Models fetched directly from the HuggingFace API, with
  curated frozen fallbacks for offline or rate-limited use.

## Features

- **Auto-detect hardware** — NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, Apple Silicon, CPU-only
- **Smart ranking** — Scores models by VRAM fit, speed, and benchmark quality
- **One-command chat** — `whichllm run` downloads and starts a chat session instantly
- **Code snippets** — `whichllm snippet` prints ready-to-run Python for any model
- **Live data** — Fetches models directly from HuggingFace (cached for performance)
- **Benchmark-aware** — Integrates real eval scores with confidence-based dampening
- **Task profiles** — Filter by general, coding, vision, or math use cases
- **GPU simulation** — Test with any GPU: `whichllm --gpu "RTX 4090"`
- **Multi-GPU simulation** — Repeat `--gpu`, use commas, or write `2x RTX 4090`
- **Full-GPU filter** — `--gpu-only` / `--fit full-gpu` hides offload candidates
- **Speed-aware filtering** — `--speed usable|fast` hides slow rows by threshold
- **Markdown output** — `--markdown` / `-m` prints pasteable GFM tables
- **Runtime memory budgets** — `--vram-headroom` and `--ram-budget` avoid edge fits
- **Hardware planning** — Reverse lookup: `whichllm plan "llama 3 70b"`
- **Upgrade planning** — Compare your current machine with candidate GPUs
- **JSON output** — Pipe-friendly: `whichllm --json`

## Run & Snippet

Try any model with a single command. No manual installs needed — whichllm
creates an isolated environment via `uv`, installs dependencies, downloads the
model, and starts an interactive chat.

![run demo](assets/demo-run.gif)

```bash
# Chat with a model (auto-picks the best GGUF variant)
whichllm run "qwen 2.5 1.5b gguf"

# Auto-pick the best model for your hardware and chat
whichllm run

# CPU-only mode
whichllm run "phi 3 mini gguf" --cpu-only
```

Works with **all model formats**:
- **GGUF** — via `llama-cpp-python` (lightweight, fast)
- **AWQ / GPTQ** — via `transformers` + `autoawq` / `auto-gptq`
- **FP16 / BF16** — via `transformers`

Get a **copy-paste Python snippet** instead:

```bash
whichllm snippet "qwen 7b"
```

```python
from llama_cpp import Llama

llm = Llama.from_pretrained(
    repo_id="Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GGUF",
    filename="qwen2.5-7b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf",
    n_ctx=4096,
    n_gpu_layers=-1,
    verbose=False,
)

output = llm.create_chat_completion(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
)
print(output["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```

Markdown output is intended for GitHub issues, READMEs, Slack, Discord, and
blog posts:

```bash
whichllm --markdown
whichllm -m --top 5 --gpu "RTX 4090"
```

JSON model rows include `fit_type`, `vram_required_bytes`,
`vram_available_bytes`, `uses_multi_gpu`, `multi_gpu_effective_vram_bytes`,
`estimated_tok_per_sec`, `speed_confidence`, `speed_range_tok_per_sec`,
`speed_notes`, `benchmark_source`, and `benchmark_confidence`. The speed range
is a planning range, not a live benchmark.

## Integrations

### Ollama

Use JSON output to feed scripts that map HuggingFace IDs to your local Ollama
model names:

```bash
# Pick the top HuggingFace model ID
whichllm --top 1 --json | jq -r '.models[0].model_id'

# Find the best coding model ID
whichllm --profile coding --top 1 --json | jq -r '.models[0].model_id'
```

Ollama model names do not always match HuggingFace repo IDs, so a small mapping
step is usually needed before `ollama run`.

### Shell alias

Add to your `.bashrc` / `.zshrc`:

```bash
alias bestllm='whichllm --top 1 --json | jq -r ".models[0].model_id"'
# Usage: ollama run $(bestllm)
```

## Scoring

Each model gets a 0-100 score. Benchmark quality and size form the core;
evidence confidence and runtime fit then scale it, with speed, source
trust, and popularity as adjustments.

| Factor | Effect | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Benchmark quality | core | Merged LiveBench / Artificial Analysis / Aider / Vision / Arena ELO / Open LLM Leaderboard, weighted by source confidence |
| Model size | up to 35 | `log2`-scaled world-knowledge proxy (MoE uses total params) |
| Quantization | × penalty | Lower-bit quants discounted multiplicatively |
| Evidence confidence | ×0.55–1.0 | none / self-reported ×0.55, inherited ×0.78, direct full |
| Runtime fit | ×0.50–1.0 | partial-offload ×0.72, CPU-only ×0.50 |
| Speed | -8 to +8 | Usability gate vs a fit-dependent tok/s floor; reported with confidence and range metadata |
| Source trust | -5 to +5 | Official-org bonus, known-repackager penalty |
| Popularity | tie-breaker | Downloads/likes; weight shrinks as evidence strengthens |

Score markers:
- **`~`** (yellow) — No direct benchmark; score inherited/interpolated from the model family
- **`!sr`** (bright yellow) — Uploader-reported benchmark only, not independently verified
- **`?`** (red) — No benchmark data available

Speed display:
- **red** — Slow generation speed (`<4 tok/s`)
- **yellow** — Marginal generation speed (`4-10 tok/s`)
- **green** — Usable generation speed (`10-30 tok/s`)
- **bright green** — Fast local generation speed (`>=30 tok/s`)
- **`~`** (yellow) — Estimated tok/s range is available
- **`?`** (red) — Low-confidence speed estimate; backend/runtime sensitivity is high

## How it works

### Data pipeline

1. **Model fetching** — Fetches popular models from HuggingFace API:
   - Text-generation (downloads + recently updated)
   - GGUF-filtered (separate query for coverage)
   - Vision models (`image-text-to-text`) when `--profile vision` or `any`
2. **Benchmark sources** — *Current tier* (LiveBench, Artificial Analysis
   Index, Aider) merged live when reachable, plus a curated multimodal /
   vision index; *frozen tier* (Open LLM Leaderboard v2, Chatbot Arena
   ELO). Tiers have separate caps and lineage-aware recency demotion so
   stale leaderboards stop over-rewarding older generations.
3. **Benchmark evidence** — Five resolution levels, increasingly discounted:
   - `direct` — Exact model ID match
   - `variant` — Suffix-stripped or -Instruct variant
   - `base_model` — Base model from cardData
   - `line_interp` — Size-aware interpolation within model family
   - `self_reported` — Uploader-claimed eval (heavily discounted)

   Inheritance is rejected when a model's params diverge more than 2× from
   its family's dominant member, catching draft / MTP / abliterated forks
   that share a `family_id` with a much larger base.
4. **Cache** — normally `~/.cache/whichllm/`, or `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/whichllm/`
   when `XDG_CACHE_HOME` is set to an absolute path:
   - `models.json` — 6h TTL
   - `benchmark.json` — 24h TTL

### Ranking engine

1. **Hardware detection** — NVIDIA (nvidia-ml-py), AMD (ROCm/dbgpu), Intel, Apple Silicon (Metal), CPU cores, RAM, disk
2. **VRAM estimation** — Weights + KV cache + activation + framework overhead (~500MB)
3. **Compatibility** — Full GPU / Partial Offload / CPU-only; compute capability and OS checks
4. **Speed** — tok/s from GPU memory bandwidth, quantization, backend, fit type, and MoE active parameters
5. **Scoring** — Benchmark (with confidence dampening), size, quantization penalty, fit type, speed, popularity, source trust (official vs repackager)
6. **Backend filter** — Apple Silicon and CPU-only restrict to GGUF for stability; Linux+NVIDIA allows AWQ/GPTQ
