# Awesome AutoResearch [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of AutoResearch use cases **with optimization traces** and open source implementations. Every entry includes a link to the actual optimization trajectory so you can see what the agent tried, not just the final result.

## What is AutoResearch?

AutoResearch is, at its core, a prompt. Karpathy released it as a single markdown file - `program.md`, that instructs a coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, or similar) to follow an optimization workflow. The agent edits one file (`train.py`, that trains a language model), runs for a fixed 5 minutes on a GPU, checks whether the metric improved, and either commits the change or reverts it. Then it loops forever.

</p>

The specific `program.md` that ships with AutoResearch is written for one task: training a GPT model. But the structure - iteratively optimizing a file against an evaluation metric, with a discard/keep loop - turns out to be portable. In the weeks since release, the community has adapted it to GPU kernel optimization, template engine optimization, tabular ML engineering, and more. The `program.md` for each of these looks different, but the loop is the same.
