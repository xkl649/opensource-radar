## ⚙️ Qwen MTP GGUF Conversion Skill

The [`qwen-mtp-gguf`](qwen-mtp-gguf/) subproject supports Qwen-family MTP / nextn GGUF release workflows. It performs disk, RAM, tooling, token-access, and compatibility preflight checks, extracts compatible MTP tensors, injects them into the target model, converts with llama.cpp, smoke-tests outputs, quantizes releases, and supports safer upload/resume workflows.

## 🧠 High-Fidelity Dataset Catalog

The repository includes 24 curated high-fidelity datasets for reasoning, mathematics, coding, instruction following, conversation, and domain-specific distillation. Browse the full [dataset catalog](High-fidelity%20Dataset/README.md), or use [`download_datasets.py`](download_datasets.py) to batch download the suite for local training.

## 🤝 Open-Source Commitment

This project keeps the training source code and documentation for released fine-tuned models available so learners can reproduce, inspect, and adapt the workflows. The longer project philosophy and original message to builders are preserved in [docs/PROJECT_PHILOSOPHY.md](docs/PROJECT_PHILOSOPHY.md).
