The SenseNova model family plugs directly into agent runtimes such as [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/) and [hermes-agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent), with the skills in this repository extending the models with concrete, end-to-end office capabilities.

In this repository each skill lives in its own directory and declares triggers, capabilities, and execution flow through a `SKILL.md` file, following the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) convention.

The skills cover **image generation & visualization**, **slide-deck (PPT) generation**, **Excel data analysis**, and **deep research** — usable standalone or composed into end-to-end workflows.

## 🦝 Available out-of-the-box in Raccoon

The latest SenseNova models and the full Cowork-Skill suite in this repo are bundled into [**Raccoon**](https://office.xiaohuanxiong.com/home), with enterprise-grade security and a zero-setup experience — if you'd rather not provision env, API keys, and runtimes yourself, you can use these capabilities directly through Raccoon. Free trial available — no payment required to get started.

Raccoon now ships a full upgrade across product capability and client experience:

- **Three core office capabilities, strengthened**: powered by SenseNova 6.7 Flash + Cowork-Skill, data analysis, PPT generation, and task planning each take a step up — covering the full loop from multi-file cleaning/analysis to formal report decks, industry/competitive research, and investment memos.
- **New: infographic generation**: built on the SenseNova U1 model, compresses complex data, long reports, and business insights into dense, structured, visual infographics that are easier to digest and share.

## How to Use

These skills are designed to run inside an [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/)-compatible agent.

- **Recommended runtime**: pair them with **[OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/)** or **[hermes-agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent)**.
- **Recommended LLM**: pair them with the **SenseNova Platform API**.
  International: [platform.sensenova.ai/docs](https://platform.sensenova.ai/docs), Base URL `https://token.sensenova.ai/v1`
  Mainland China: [platform.sensenova.cn/token-plan](https://platform.sensenova.cn/token-plan), Base URL `https://token.sensenova.cn/v1`
- **Install & configure**: follow the full walkthrough in **[`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md)**.

> This repo documents both the international and mainland China SenseNova API flows. Make sure the docs page, API key, base URL, and model name all come from the same region.

**Recommended: let the agent install the skills for you.** Hand it the repo URL and ask it to clone and drop the skills into the right directory — for example:

> *"Please install SenseNova-Skills from https://github.com/OpenSenseNova/SenseNova-Skills into your skills directory."*

After it finishes, **you may need to manually restart the agent service** before the new skills are picked up.

| Agent | Target directory |
|-------|------------------|
| [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/) | `~/.openclaw/skills/` |
| [hermes-agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) | `~/.hermes/skills/` |

<details>
<summary>Prefer to install manually?</summary>

Clone this repository, then copy the subdirectories under `skills/` into the target directory yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenSenseNova/SenseNova-Skills.git --depth=1
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/skills
cp -r SenseNova-Skills/skills/* ~/.openclaw/skills/
```

For Hermes, swap the target to `~/.hermes/skills/`.

## Sample Outputs

### 🎨 Infographic (sn-infographic)

A few `sn-infographic` outputs (more in [`docs/sn-infographic-examples.md`](docs/sn-infographic-examples.md)).

### 🧩 Memory price analysis — insight → analysis → presentation → end-to-end workflow

[`examples/memory-price-end2end-analysis`](examples/memory-price-end2end-analysis/). Starting from a raw quote CSV, the agent profiles fields, normalizes categories and timestamps, then attacks the rally from three angles — overall trend, top movers per category, and the gap between server-grade and consumer-grade SKUs — locating a late-February inflection along the way. Treating those findings as the research question, it switches to deep research: planning per-dimension web searches over supply contraction, AI-server demand, and vendor output discipline, then triaging and cross-checking evidence across sources before committing it to the report. The data and research conclusions are then handed to PPT generation, which lays out a 16-page outline, plans per-slot imagery, renders per-page HTML, runs VLM review, and finally composites screenshots into the PPTX. The result is a clear three-step storyline: prices *are* rising → *here is why* → *here is what to do*. This is the only example that exercises the full data analysis → deep research → PPT chain end-to-end.

- Depends on: [`sn-da-excel-workflow`](skills/sn-da-excel-workflow/SKILL.md), [`sn-deep-research`](skills/sn-deep-research/SKILL.md), [`sn-ppt-entry`](skills/sn-ppt-entry/SKILL.md), [`sn-ppt-standard`](skills/sn-ppt-standard/SKILL.md), [`sn-md-to-html-report`](skills/sn-md-to-html-report/SKILL.md)

### 📊 Employee performance analysis — data analysis

[`examples/employee-performance-analysis`](examples/employee-performance-analysis/). The agent reads 10 separate monthly review xlsx files, aligns column schemas across months and joins them into one longitudinal table. From that table it produces aggregate views — monthly average trend, score-distribution boxplots, grade mix change, and a 38-role ranking — and individual views — top performers, needs-attention, and consistently-improving cohorts plus per-employee year trends. The findings are written up with explicit improvement suggestions tied to specific roles and individuals, backed by 8 supporting charts. The same content is delivered as a Word doc (for distribution) and a visualized HTML report (for browsing). The example shows how `sn-da-excel-workflow` handles "many small spreadsheets that should be one analysis" rather than a single big file.

### 🔬 Embodied AI industry research — deep research

[`examples/embodied-ai-deep-research`](examples/embodied-ai-deep-research/). Given only an industry name, the agent first commits to a research plan — market size, vendor share, financing, cost structure, development roadmap — instead of jumping straight into search. For each dimension it runs targeted web searches, fetches and reads source pages, and extracts both numeric and qualitative evidence; conflicting figures across sources are explicitly reconciled before being trusted. A synthesis stage organizes per-dimension evidence into a traceable, reader-oriented information structure rather than a stack of disconnected bullets. The output is an illustrated report (Markdown + visualized HTML) with 5 dimension-specific charts. The example shows how `sn-deep-research` turns "go research X" into a structured plan-then-execute loop with traceable evidence.

- Depends on: [`sn-deep-research`](skills/sn-deep-research/SKILL.md)

### 🎯 Property fee pricing — PPT generation

[`examples/property-fee-pricing-ppt`](examples/property-fee-pricing-ppt/). The agent takes a free-form brief — topic (property fee pricing), audience (property staff + committee), 26 pages, black-and-white warm style — and first commits to an outline plus a per-page asset plan that conforms to the style spec. Each slide is then built as semantic per-page HTML rather than free-form image generation: copy, layout, illustrations, icons, and any data charts are reasoned about per slot. Imagery is produced or selected per slot and VLM-checked against the page's intent; each rendered page goes through a review pass with optional rewrite for coherence and copy quality. Final pages are screenshotted and composited into the PPTX, with the per-page HTML kept alongside for direct browser preview or re-editing. The example demonstrates `sn-ppt-standard` style consistency on a long, prose-heavy deck where every slide must obey the same audience and palette constraints.

## FAQ

Common setup and runtime questions (400/401 errors, rate limits, PPT timeouts, infographic quality, model names) are answered in [`docs/faq.md`](docs/faq.md).

## Contributing

Feel free to use the skills here as templates for your own OpenClaw skills. The qualities that make a skill good:

- **Clear triggers**: state in `description` exactly when the skill should and should not run, so the agent recognizes it accurately
- **Focused scope**: each skill does one thing well; complex workflows compose multiple skills
- **Solid documentation**: examples, artifact contracts, edge cases, failure handling
- **Supporting resources**: use `references/`, `scripts/`, `prompts/` to provide additional context
