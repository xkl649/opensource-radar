# AI Agents From Scratch

Learn to build AI agents locally without frameworks. Understand what happens under the hood before using production frameworks.

![Agent architecture overview](diagrams/agent-architecture.png)


## Purpose

This repository teaches you to build AI agents from first principles using **local LLMs** and **node-llama-cpp**. By working through these examples, you'll understand:

- How LLMs work at a fundamental level
- What agents really are (LLM + tools + patterns)
- How different agent architectures function
- Why frameworks make certain design choices

> A Python version of this tutorial is available here:
> https://github.com/pguso/agents-from-scratch

**Philosophy**: Learn by building. Understand deeply, then use frameworks wisely.

## Companion Website 

This repository now has a **matching companion website**:

**https://agentsfromscratch.com**

The website is **not a replacement for this repo**, but a **conceptual companion** that:

- Explains *why* each example exists  
- Visualizes the learning path from raw LLM calls to full agents  
- Separates **code**, **explanations**, and **core concepts**  
- Helps you understand agent architectures before using frameworks  

**Recommended workflow:**
- Use **GitHub** for running, modifying, and studying the code  
- Use the **website** for mental models, explanations, and progression  

> Think of the site as the *map* and this repo as the *terrain*.

## Core Concepts

### What is an AI Agent?

```
AI Agent = LLM + System Prompt + Tools + Memory + Reasoning Pattern
           ─┬─   ──────┬──────   ──┬──   ──┬───   ────────┬────────
            │          │           │       │              │
         Brain      Identity    Hands   State         Strategy
```

### Evolution of Capabilities

```
1. intro          → Basic LLM usage
2. translation    → Specialized behavior (system prompts)
3. think          → Reasoning ability
4. batch          → Parallel processing
5. coding         → Streaming & control
6. simple-agent   → Tool use (function calling)
7. memory-agent   → Persistent state
8. react-agent    → Strategic reasoning + tool use
```

### Architecture Patterns

**Simple Agent (Steps 1-5)**
```
User → LLM → Response
```

**Tool-Using Agent (Step 6)**
```
User → LLM ⟷ Tools → Response
```

**Memory Agent (Step 7)**
```
User → LLM ⟷ Tools → Response
       ↕
     Memory
```

**ReAct Agent (Step 8)**
```
User → LLM → Think → Act → Observe
       ↑      ↓      ↓      ↓
       └──────┴──────┴──────┘
           Iterate until solved
```

## Working with me

If this repo was useful and you have a project that needs ai workflows, context
engineering, RAG, or local/production LLM work done properly, I'm
open to freelance or contract engagements.

- Email: [pguso@gmx.de](mailto:pguso@gmx.de)
- LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/patric-gutersohn-466046167/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patric-gutersohn-466046167/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme)

No pressure either way - glad if the repo was useful on its own.
