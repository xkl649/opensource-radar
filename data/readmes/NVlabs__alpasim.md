## What is AlpaSim?

AlpaSim is an open-source autonomous vehicle simulation platform designed specifically for research
and development. It allows users to test end-to-end AV policies in a closed-loop setting by
simulating realistic sensor data, vehicle dynamics, and traffic scenarios within a modular and
extensible testbed.

Suitable use cases include:

- **Algorithm Validation**: Test new autonomous driving algorithms in realistic environments
- **Safety Analysis**: Evaluate vehicle behavior in edge cases and challenging scenarios
- **Performance Benchmarking/Regression Testing**: Compare different models and configurations
- **Debugging**: Understand and debug complex autonomous driving behaviors

### **Sensor Fidelity**

- Pluggable renderer service with default [NuRec](https://docs.nvidia.com/nurec/) support and
  [OmniDreams](https://github.com/nv-tlabs/omni-dreams) video-model rendering through
  [FlashDreams](https://github.com/NVIDIA/flashdreams)
- High-fidelity camera feeds with configurable field-of-view, resolution, and frame rates
- Stateful video-model rendering for stronger dynamic-object and non-rigid visual fidelity
- Realistic sensor noise and environmental conditions

### **Research Hackability**

- Python-based implementation built for rapid prototyping and experimentation
- Modular grpc interface design allows researchers to swap out components with custom
  implementations
- Extensive configuration options and debugging tools

### **Horizontal Scalability**

- Microservices architecture enabling distributed computing
- Scale individual components for optimal load balancing
- Support for multi-node deployments

To learn more about the design principles and architecture, check out the
[system design docs](docs/DESIGN.md).

## Driving Policies

AlpaSim currently supports the following driver policies:

- [Alpamayo-R1](https://github.com/NVlabs/alpamayo) - NVIDIA Alpamayo, a VLA driving policy with
  chain-of-causation reasoning
- [Alpamayo 1.5](https://github.com/NVlabs/alpamayo1.5) - Public Alpamayo 1.5 checkpoint support
  is also available
- [VaVAM](https://github.com/valeoai/VideoActionModel) - an autoregressive video-action driving
  policy
- [Transfuser](https://github.com/autonomousvision/lead?tab=readme-ov-file#beyond-carla-cross-benchmark-deployment)
  \- Latent TransFuser v6 ([LTFv6](<(https://huggingface.co/ln2697/tfv6_navsim)>)) policy developed
  for [NAVSIM](https://github.com/autonomousvision/navsim) (provisional)

Stay tuned for additional model support. [Contributions](#contributing) from the community are
appreciated.

## Support

📣 **Usage questions and discussion about AlpaSim**: please join us on the [Alpamayo NV Developer Forum](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/c/autonomous-vehicles/alpamayo/766).

🐛 **Code-level bugs, documentation issues, and feature requests**: file a [GitHub issue](../../issues/new/choose) using the appropriate template (Bug report, Documentation request, or Feature request). The relevant NVIDIA responder is auto-assigned via the `assignees:` field on the template.

🚨 **Security vulnerabilities**: please use [NVIDIA's Vulnerability Disclosure Program](https://app.intigriti.com/programs/nvidia/nvidiavdp/detail). Do not file security issues publicly here.

## Getting Started

To run simulations locally (Docker Compose, single machine), see the [Tutorial](docs/TUTORIAL.md).
The default tutorial path uses NuRec; for OmniDreams as the renderer backend, see the
[Video Model Renderer guide](docs/VIDEO_MODEL.md).
For cluster or SLURM deployment, see `src/tools/run-on-slurm`.
