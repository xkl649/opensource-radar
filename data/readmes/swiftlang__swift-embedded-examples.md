# Embedded Swift Example Projects

This repository is a set of demonstration projects of **Embedded Swift**. Embedded Swift is a compilation and language mode that enables development of baremetal, embedded and standalone software in Swift. To learn more, see:

## Building the examples

Each example in this repository contains build and deployment instructions, however there are a couple common steps needed for many of the examples included below:

1. Install [`swift`](https://swift.org) using the [instructions here](https://docs.swift.org/embedded/documentation/embedded/installembeddedswift).

2. Install [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), "an extremely fast Python package and project manager", using the [instructions here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

Note that the SDK integration examples (Pico SDK, Zephyr SDK, etc.) are not recommendations or endorsement, the same is true for build system choice (Make, CMake, SwiftPM, shell scripts). Embedded Swift aims to be versatile and allowing integration into existing SDKs and build systems, and the example projects show some of the possibilities.
