## What is DarkMoon?

DarkMoon is an **automated penetration testing tool** that orchestrates complete security assessments using **artificial intelligence security** agents. Built as an open-source **cybersecurity tool**, it enables organizations to run professional-grade **vulnerability assessments** without manual intervention.

Instead of replacing the pentester, DarkMoon acts as an **autonomous security testing system**, it reasons, plans, and coordinates specialized agents that execute real offensive security operations through a controlled execution layer.

## Why DarkMoon?

Traditional **penetration testing** is:

- ⏱️ **Time-consuming**, manual testing takes weeks
- 💰 **Expensive**, expert consultants cost thousands per day
- 🔄 **Inconsistent**, results vary by tester expertise
- 📊 **Hard to scale**, limited by human resources

DarkMoon solves this with **AI penetration testing**:

- 🤖 **AI-powered pentesting**, autonomous agents conduct full security assessments end-to-end
- 🛡️ **Security by design**, the AI never directly executes tools; all actions flow through a controlled MCP interface
- 🕶️ **Privacy gateway (reversible local tokenization)**, the AI **never sees your real sensitive values**. IPs, hostnames, domains, URLs, emails, credentials and internal paths are replaced by deterministic placeholders (`IP_PRIVATE_001`, …); real values are injected **locally, right before a tool runs**, and masked back out of every result. **No sensitive data ever leaves your perimeter to the LLM provider**, use Claude's power under strict data-sovereignty constraints. Exfiltration attempts are blocked.
- ♾️ **Pentesting automation for CI/CD**, run **automated security testing** post-build to catch critical vulnerabilities before production
- 🔧 **50+ integrated tools**, a comprehensive **penetration testing tools suite** (Nuclei, NetExec, BloodHound, sqlmap, Naabu, httpx, ffuf, and more)
- 📈 **Adaptive multi-agent methodology**, specialized agents for Web, Active Directory, Kubernetes, Network, CMS, and more
- 📝 **Vulnerability reporting automation**, structured, evidence-based reports generated automatically

Perfect for **security teams**, **DevSecOps engineers**, **ethical hacking** professionals, and organizations of all sizes.

## 📊 Benchmark: 57 real vulnerabilities on OWASP Juice Shop

Real, reproducible **black-box** run against OWASP Juice Shop on a **local LLM** (nothing leaves your infrastructure):

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| Vulnerabilities found | **57** (8 critical / 24 high / 21 medium / 4 low) |
| Wall-clock time | **28.5 min** |
| Proof-of-exploitation | per finding |
| LLM | local (Ollama / llama.cpp) |

Reproduce it and compare tools yourself: **[ASCIT31/Darkmoon-Benchmarks](https://github.com/ASCIT31/Darkmoon-Benchmarks)**.

*Compiled from public repos/docs (2026-08); corrections welcome via PR.*

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- An LLM API key (OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, or local models)

> **Note:** GPU configuration, NVIDIA driver troubleshooting, and advanced environment setup are covered in the [Full Documentation, GPU Troubleshooting](docs/full.md#ii2--darkmoon--gpu-troubleshooting-guide-official).

### Installation

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ASCIT31/Dark-Moon.git
cd Dark-Moon
```

**2. Configure your LLM provider**

`install.sh` handles provider configuration interactively, no need to edit `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
./install.sh           # skip form if .opencode.env already configured
./install.sh --init    # force reconfiguration (cloud or local model)
./install.sh --help    # show usage
```

Supports **cloud providers** (Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter…) and **local models** (Ollama, llama.cpp).

> **Note:** For full details on environment variables and local model setup, see the [Full Documentation, Environment Variables](docs/full.md#ii3-configuration-of-environment-variables).

**3. Build and launch**

```bash
./install.sh  # Clean install with full stack reset
```

**4. Run your first assessment**

```bash
./darkmoon.sh "TARGET: example.com"
```

**5. Monitor in real-time**

```bash
./darkmoon.sh --log <session_id>
```

> **Note:** Real-time session logs display every command executed by the MCP server. See [Full Documentation, Session Logs](docs/full.md#ii7e-step-1--start-an-assessment) for details.

## How It Works

DarkMoon operates as a strategic **AI security agent** orchestrator aligned with ISO 27001, NIST SP 800-115, and MITRE ATT&CK methodologies.

When you provide a target, the platform automatically:

1. 🔍 **Discovers** the target environment (ports, services, protocols)
2. 🧠 **Fingerprints** the technology stack (frameworks, CMS, APIs)
3. 🎯 **Models** the attack surface
4. 🚀 **Deploys** specialized sub-agents based on detected technologies
5. 🔬 **Executes** an **intelligent vulnerability scanning** loop with reactive adaptation
6. ✅ **Validates** findings with evidence (requests, payloads, responses)
7. 📝 **Generates** a structured audit report

### Sub-Agent Orchestration

DarkMoon dynamically selects and dispatches specialized agents depending on the technologies discovered:

| Detected Technology | Agent Triggered |
|---|---|
| WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, Magento, PrestaShop, Moodle | CMS-specific agent |
| PHP, Node.js, Flask, ASP.NET, Spring Boot, Ruby on Rails, Go | Stack-specific agent |
| GraphQL | GraphQL agent |
| Active Directory | AD agent |
| Kubernetes | Kubernetes agent |
| AWS, Azure, GCP | Cloud-provider agent |
| Entra ID (Microsoft identity) | Identity agent |
| GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins | SCM & CI/CD agent |
| Terraform, Ansible | Infrastructure-as-Code agent |
| Docker, container registries | Container agent |
| HashiCorp Vault | Secrets agent |
| PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle | Database agent |
| Redis, RabbitMQ, Kafka, MQTT | Messaging & cache agent |
| Firmware / IoT images | Firmware agent |
| Headless browser required | Headless browser agent |

Multiple agents can execute **in parallel** across hybrid architectures.

Planes that require credentials to be meaningful (cloud accounts, CI/CD, secret stores, databases, Active Directory, Kubernetes) are **never dispatched on inference**. They fire only when a concrete artifact is found (a key, a token, a reachable metadata endpoint) or when you authorize them explicitly, and are otherwise flagged in the report.

> **Note:** For the complete list of agents, their structure, lifecycle, and how to create custom agents, see [Full Documentation, AI Agents](docs/full.md#v-ai-agents).

### Architecture Overview

```
User ──> DarkmoonCLI ──> OpenCode (AI Brain) ──> MCP (Security Gatekeeper) ──> Docker Toolbox (Real Tools)
```

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User
  participant O as OpenCode
  participant A as AI Agent
  participant M as MCP Darkmoon
  participant T as Docker Toolbox

  U->>O: User prompt
  O->>A: Delegate task
  A->>M: MCP function call
  M->>T: Execute real tool
  T-->>M: Results
  M-->>A: Structured output
  A-->>O: Next decision
  O-->>U: Summary / result
```

The AI reasons and plans. The MCP controls what can be executed. The Toolbox runs isolated tools inside Docker. **The AI never directly touches the system**, this is **security by design**.

> **Note:** For the full architecture breakdown (deployment diagrams, network flows, security boundaries), see [Full Documentation, Architecture](docs/full.md#iv-architecture).

## Scope Definition

DarkMoon supports flexible scope definition directly from the command line.

**Quick pentest (zero config):**

```bash
./darkmoon.sh "TARGET: http://172.19.0.3:3000"
```

**Bug bounty mode (flags activate automatically):**

```bash
./darkmoon.sh "TARGET: http://172.19.0.3:3000 PROGRAM=\"Juice Shop\" FOCUS=sqli,xss,idor NOISE=moderate FORMAT=h1"
```

Key flags include `FOCUS`, `EXCLUDE`, `CREDS`, `TOKEN`, `NOISE`, `SEVERITY`, `FORMAT`, and more, all interpreted naturally by the AI.

> **Note:** For the complete flags reference, asset types, EXCLUDE/FOCUS free-form syntax, and advanced multi-target scoping, see [Full Documentation, Scope Definition](docs/full.md#ii7c-launch-darkmoon-with-tui-console).
