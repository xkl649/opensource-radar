## 📖 What Is This?

This is a **12-chapter, 7,500+ line interactive textbook** that teaches you how to build, train and run a modern language model from absolute scratch. The same family of architecture behind ChatGPT, Claude, LLaMA and Mistral.

Alongside the chapters there are **28 standalone topic explainers** covering every technique in depth. RoPE, attention, RMSNorm, SwiGLU, KV cache, AdamW, mixed precision and more. Plus two narrative walkthroughs that trace a single sentence through the entire model step by step. Each file follows the same style: child language, no jargon, a code example you can run.

You won't just read about Transformers. You'll **write every line yourself**: tokenizer, embeddings, attention, training loop, inference engine. Every single line annotated to explain **what** it does and **why** it's there.

---

## 🤔 Why This Exists

Most ML tutorials fall into one of two traps:

| ❌ Too Shallow | ❌ Too Academic | ✅ This Guide |
|---|---|---|
| `model = GPT().fit(data)` | 40-page papers, dense notation | 5-year-old analogies → full working code |
| You learn to call APIs | Assumes PhD in ML | Zero ML experience required |
| No understanding of internals | No worked examples | Every line annotated with WHAT & WHY |

**The goal:** After finishing, you won't just know that attention "works". You'll understand the variance argument behind `1/√d_k`. How RoPE captures relative position through rotation. Why pre-norm beats post-norm for deep networks. And exactly where every gradient flows during backpropagation.

---

## 👥 Who Is This For?

| 🧑‍💻 You Are... | 📚 You Need... |
|---|---|
| A Python developer curious about how ChatGPT actually works | Basic Python (functions, classes, lists). No ML experience |
| A student who wants to deeply understand Transformers | Willingness to read ~3,500 lines of commented code |
| An engineer evaluating LLM architectures | Understanding of tradeoffs (RoPE vs learned, RMSNorm vs LayerNorm) |
| Someone who got lost at "attention" in other tutorials | Party analogy + worked numeric example with real numbers |

**🔧 Prerequisites:** Python basics (variables, functions, classes, `pip install`). That's it. No calculus, no linear algebra, no PyTorch experience required. We teach those as we go.

## 🏛️ Architecture

This guide implements the **latest publicly-documented** decoder-only Transformer:

| 🧬 Technique | 📦 Source Model | ⚡ Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **RoPE** | LLaMA, Mistral, Qwen | Relative position without learned parameters |
| **RMSNorm** | LLaMA, Mistral, Gemma | 15% faster than LayerNorm, equally effective |
| **SwiGLU** | PaLM, LLaMA, Gemini | Learns which information to pass or block |
| **Pre-Norm** | GPT-3, all modern | Stable training at 100+ layers |
| **AdamW** | GPT-3+ | Better generalization than vanilla Adam |
| **BPE** | GPT-2/3/4 | Handles any text. Even unseen words and emoji |
| **Weight Tying** | GPT-2/3 | Saves 30% parameters, improves training signal |
| **Mixed Precision** | All production LLMs | 2× speed, half memory, same quality |

> ℹ️ GPT-4 and Claude architectures are proprietary/undisclosed. This teaches the best publicly-confirmed architecture: what LLaMA 3, Mistral and Qwen 2.5 use.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/raiyanyahya/how-to-train-your-gpt.git
cd how-to-train-your-gpt

# 2. Create environment
python -m venv gpt_env
source gpt_env/bin/activate          # Mac/Linux
# gpt_env\Scripts\activate           # Windows

# 3. Install dependencies (CPU version. For GPU see below)
pip install torch tiktoken datasets numpy matplotlib --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# Or use the requirements file
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Verify GPU (optional but recommended)
python -c "import torch; print(f'CUDA: {torch.cuda.is_available()}')"

# 5. Start reading!
open chapters/00_overview.md
```

Run the training script:

```bash
python main.py
```

This uses the tiny config (d_model=256, 4 layers) by default. Training takes a few minutes on CPU. For the GPT-2 scale config (151M params, 768 dims, 12 layers), edit the config in main.py and uncomment the larger configuration.

> 💻 The default config uses a tiny model (d_model=256, 4 layers, 17M params) that runs in minutes on CPU. For the full GPT-2 scale (151M params, 768 dims, 12 layers), edit the config in `main.py` and uncomment the larger configuration. You'll need a GPU for that one.

---

## 📓 Jupyter Notebooks

Alongside the textbook, each chapter has a companion notebook you can run live. These strip away the explanations and give you pure, clean code that executes from top to bottom. If the textbook teaches you why, the notebooks let you see it happen.

We're going to run this whole project on a very small dataset so you can watch training happen in minutes rather than weeks. Every notebook is self-contained. Open it, run all cells and you'll see the model learn in real time.

```bash
# Install everything you need
pip install jupyter tiktoken torch numpy datasets matplotlib --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# Start with chapter 2 (tokenization)
jupyter notebook notebooks/02_tokenization.ipynb
```

Notebooks live in the `notebooks/` directory, one per chapter. Open any of them and hit **Cell → Run All**.
