**React Native ExecuTorch** provides a declarative way to run AI models on-device using React Native, powered by **ExecuTorch** :rocket:. It offers out-of-the-box support for a wide range of LLMs, computer vision models, and more. Visit our [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/software-mansion) page to explore these models.

[**ExecuTorch**](https://executorch.ai), developed by Meta, is a novel framework allowing AI model execution on devices like mobile phones or microcontrollers.

React Native ExecuTorch bridges the gap between React Native and native platform capabilities, enabling developers to efficiently run local AI models on mobile devices. This can be achieved without the need for extensive expertise in native programming or machine learning.

## Supported Versions

The minimal supported version are:
* iOS 17.0
* Android 13
* React Native - see [compatibility table](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-executorch/docs/next/other/compatibility)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> React Native ExecuTorch supports only the [New React Native architecture](https://reactnative.dev/architecture/landing-page).

## Real-world Example

React Native ExecuTorch is powering [Private Mind](https://privatemind.swmansion.com/), a privacy-first mobile AI app available on [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/private-mind/id6746713439) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.swmansion.privatemind).

## Quickstart - Running LFM2.5

**Get started with AI-powered text generation in 3 easy steps!**

The steps below assume an Expo project. For bare React Native, follow the [Getting Started guide](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-executorch/docs/fundamentals/getting-started) in the documentation.

### :one: Installation

```bash
# Install the package
yarn add react-native-executorch

# Add these packages for resource fetching:
yarn add react-native-executorch-expo-resource-fetcher
yarn add expo-file-system expo-asset

# Depending on the platform, choose either iOS or Android
yarn <ios|android>
```

> npm and pnpm work too — use `npm install` or `pnpm add` for the packages, and `npm run <ios|android>` / `pnpm <ios|android>` for the run step.

### :two: Setup & Initialization

Add this to your component file:

```tsx
import {
  useLLM,
  models,
  Message,
  initExecutorch,
} from 'react-native-executorch';
import { ExpoResourceFetcher } from 'react-native-executorch-expo-resource-fetcher';

initExecutorch({
  resourceFetcher: ExpoResourceFetcher,
});

function MyComponent() {
  // Initialize the model 🚀
  const llm = useLLM({ model: models.llm.lfm2_5_1_2b_instruct() });
  // ... rest of your component
}
```

### :three: Run the Model!

```tsx
const handleGenerate = async () => {
  const chat: Message[] = [
    { role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant' },
    { role: 'user', content: 'What is the meaning of life?' }
  ];

  // Chat completion
  await llm.generate(chat);
  console.log('LFM2.5 says:', llm.response);
};
```

## Demo Apps

We currently host a few example [apps](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-executorch/tree/main/apps) demonstrating use cases of our library:

- `llm` - Chat application showcasing use of LLMs
- `speech` - Speech to Text & Text to Speech task implementations
- `computer-vision` - Computer vision related tasks
- `text-embeddings` - Computing text representations for semantic search
- `bare-rn` - LLM chat example for bare React Native (without Expo)

If you would like to run a demo app, first initialize the required git submodules from the repository root:

```bash
git submodule update --init packages/react-native-executorch/third-party/common
```

Then navigate to its project directory, install dependencies and run app with:

```bash
yarn && yarn <ios|android>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Running LLMs requires a significant amount of RAM. If you are encountering unexpected app crashes, try to increase the amount of RAM allocated to the emulator.

## Ready-made Models

Our library has a number of ready-to-use AI models; a complete list is available in the documentation. If you're interested in running your own AI model, you need to first export it to the `.pte` format. Instructions on how to do this are available in the [Python API](https://docs.pytorch.org/executorch/stable/using-executorch-export.html) and [optimum-executorch README](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-executorch?tab=readme-ov-file#option-2-export-and-load-separately).

## License

This library is licensed under [The MIT License](./LICENSE).
