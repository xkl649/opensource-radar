- Flashing via the web installer automatically applies the correct defaults
  
&nbsp;
</details>
<details>
<summary>📶 First-Time Setup (Wi-Fi & AP Mode)</summary>
&nbsp;
  
1. Power on the device. If WiFi fails, it auto-starts in AP mode:
   - **SSID:** `ESPTimeCast`
   - **Password:** `12345678`
   - Captive portal should open automatically, if it doesn't open `http://192.168.4.1` or `http://setup.esp` in your browser.
2. Set your WiFi and all other options.
3. Click **Save Settings** – the device saves config, reboots, and connects.
4. The device shows its local IP address after boot so you can login again for setting changes

> External links and the "Get My Location" button require internet access.  
They won't work while the device is in AP Mode - connect to WiFi first.

&nbsp;
</details>
<details>
<summary>🌐 Web Interface & Device Control</summary>
&nbsp;

ESPTimeCast includes a built-in **Web UI** that lets you fully configure and control the device from any browser, no apps required. The **Web UI** and **Companion Browser Extension** provide a human-friendly interface for features like timers, icons, stopwatch, and custom messages, using **Message Tokens** (commands such as `[TIMER 5M]` or `[STOPWATCH]`) behind the scenes so you don't have to interact with the API directly.

For automation and integrations, ESPTimeCast also provides the `/action` API that allows Home Assistant, scripts, browser extensions, and other applications to control the device directly using simple HTTP requests..

#### You can open the Web UI using either:

- http://esptimecast.local  
mDNS / Bonjour - Works on macOS, iOS, Windows with Bonjour, and most modern browsers.

- The device’s **local IP address**  
→ On every reboot, ESPTimeCast shows its IP on the LED display so you can easily connect.

#### The Web UI gives you control over:
- **WiFi settings** (SSID & Password)
- **Weather settings** (OpenWeatherMap API key, City, Country, Coordinates)
- **Time zone** (will auto-populate if TZ is found)
- **Day of the Week and Weather Description** languages
- **Display durations** for clock and weather (milliseconds)
- **Custom Scroll Text** - set a persistent scrolling message on the display directly from the Web UI
- **Advanced Settings** (see below)

&nbsp;

<summary>🚀 Manual Installation (Arduino IDE)</summary>
&nbsp;
  
There are two ways to install ESPTimeCast:

### 🥇 Recommended: Web Installer (Fastest)
Flash directly from your browser in under a minute:
https://esptimecast.com

### 🛠 Manual Installation (Arduino IDE)
If you prefer compiling and uploading manually, follow the instructions below.

#### ⚙️ ESP8266 Setup

Follow these steps to prepare your Arduino IDE for ESP8266 development:

1.  **Install ESP8266 Board Package:**
    * Open `File > Preferences` in Arduino IDE.
    * Add `http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json` to "Additional Boards Manager URLs."
    * Go to `Tools > Board > Boards Manager...`. Search for `esp8266` by `ESP8266 Community` and click "Install".
2.  **Select Your Board:**
    * Go to `Tools > Board` and select your specific board, e.g., **Wemos D1 Mini** (or your ESP8266 variant).
3.  **Configure Flash Size:**
    * Under `Tools`, select `Flash Size "4MB FS:2MB OTA:~1019KB"` or `Flash Size "Mapping defined by Hardware and Sketch"`. This ensures enough space for the sketch and LittleFS data.
4.  **Install Libraries:**
    * Go to `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...` and install the following:
        * `ArduinoJson` by Benoit Blanchon
        * `MD_Parola` by majicDesigns (this will typically also install its dependency: `MD_MAX72xx`)
        * `ESPAsyncTCP` by ESP32Async
        * `ESPAsyncWebServer` by ESP32Async (3.9.1 or above)  
&nbsp;
#### ⚙️ ESP32 Setup

Follow these steps to prepare your Arduino IDE for ESP32 development:
1.  **Install ESP32 Board Package:**
    * Go to `Tools > Board > Boards Manager...`. Search for `esp32` by `Espressif Systems` and click "Install".
2.  **Select Your Board:**
    * Go to `Tools > Board` and select your specific board, e.g., **LOLIN S2 Mini** (or your ESP32 variant).
3.  **USB CDC On Boot**
    * Go to `Tools > USB CDC On Boot` and set it to **"Enabled"** if present (not all boards have this option).
4.  **Configure Partition Scheme:**
    * Go to `Tools > Partition Scheme` and choose one of the following:
        * **For OTA support (recommended):**  
          `Minimal SPIFFS (1.9MB APP with OTA / 128KB SPIFFS)`  
          This enables wireless firmware updates via the built-in web interface.
        * **Without OTA support:**  
          `No OTA (2MB APP / 2MB SPIFFS)` or `No OTA (LARGE APP)`  
          These provide a larger filesystem but do not support OTA updates.        
&nbsp;
    > **Note:** OTA works out of the box with the official Web Installer build.  
    > Manual builds are fully supported as well - just make sure you're using the recommended pinout for your specific board as documented in this repository.  
    > **Important:** If the `Minimal SPIFFS` option does not appear, make sure you have selected **Dev Module** for your specific ESP32 chip family (e.g., ESP32 Dev Module, ESP32-S2 Dev Module, ESP32-C3 Dev Module).  

5.  **Install Libraries:**
    * Go to `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...` and install the following:
        * `ArduinoJson` by Benoit Blanchon
        * `MD_Parola` by majicDesigns (this will typically also install its dependency: `MD_MAX72xx`)
        * `AsyncTCP` by ESP32Async
        * `ESPAsyncWebServer` by ESP32Async
    
&nbsp;
#### ⬆️ Uploading the Code and Data

Once your IDE is ready:

1. **Open the Project Folder**
   * **ESP8266:** Open the `ESPTimeCast_ESP8266` folder and open `ESPTimeCast_ESP8266.ino`.
   * **ESP32:** Open the `ESPTimeCast_ESP32` folder and open `ESPTimeCast_ESP32.ino`.

2. **Upload the Sketch**
   * Click the **Upload** button (right arrow icon) in the Arduino IDE toolbar. This will compile and upload the sketch to your board.
   * **No separate LittleFS upload is needed.** All web UI files are embedded in the sketch.
  
**⚠️ Note for existing users:** If you have previously uploaded /data via LittleFS, you can safely skip that step now — the device will manage config files internally.  

&nbsp;
</details>
<details>
<summary>🏠 API & Home Assistant Integration</summary>
&nbsp;
  
ESPTimeCast exposes a unified `/action` endpoint for all device control — messages, display settings, brightness, timers, navigation, and more. It works with **Home Assistant**, **curl**, the **Chrome Extension**, or any HTTP client.


### 🧠 Message Behavior Overview

#### Web UI messages
- Act as **persistent** messages
- Remain active (even through reboots) until replaced or cleared in the Web UI
- Short messages (up to 8 characters) display **static & centered**, using the Web UI's `Weather Duration` before the display rotates to the next mode
- Long messages scroll `once` per display cycle if no `scrolls` value is sent

#### Home Assistant / API messages
- Are **temporary overrides**
- Do **not** overwrite the persistent Web UI message
- Can automatically expire using `seconds` or `scrolls`
- If neither is sent: short messages use `Weather Duration`, long messages scroll `once` per display cycle

| Source | Behavior | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Home Assistant** | Displays message temporarily | Returns to Clock/Weather rotation if no UI message exists |
| **Web UI** | Displays message persistently until manually cleared | Acts as a permanent banner or ticker |
| **Clear from Web UI** | Clears *all* messages (HA + UI) | Use this to reset the display completely |
| **Clear from HA/API** | Clears only the temporary message | UI message will reappear if one was saved |
| **Scrolls expires** | Automatic clear when limit is reached | Automatically restores the saved UI message |
| **Seconds expires** | Automatic clear when limit is reached | Automatically restores the saved UI message |

**Short messages (up to 8 characters):**
- Display static & centered (no scrolling)
- Uses `seconds` if provided, otherwise `Weather Duration`

**Long messages (8+ characters):**
- Always scroll
- Scrolling stops when `scrolls` limit is reached or when manually cleared

**The "Protected" State:**
- Sending `interrupt=0` creates a protected window — the display refuses new messages until the current one expires
- Use this for critical alerts (e.g., `LEAK DETECTED`) that you don't want overwritten
- A `409 Conflict` response means the display is currently showing a protected message
- To break a lock: send an empty message, use the Web UI Clear button, or send a new message with `interrupt=0`

&nbsp;

<summary> 🔘 Physical Buttons</summary>
&nbsp;

ESPTimeCast supports up to **4 configurable physical buttons** that can be connected directly to your ESP board for hands-free control — no app or network required.

Buttons can be configured directly from the web interface, allowing you to assign different actions to short and long presses without modifying the firmware.

### Wiring

Connect each momentary push button between a GPIO pin and **GND**.

```
GPIO Pin  ──────────────  Button  ──────────────  GND
```

ESPTimeCast uses the internal pull-up resistor automatically, so no external resistor is required.

### Configuration

1. Open the ESPTimeCast web interface
2. Navigate to **Physical Buttons**
3. Select a GPIO pin for each button
4. Assign actions for:
   - **Short Press**
   - **Long Press (800ms)**

Changes take effect immediately after clicking **Apply Settings**.

### Available Actions

Examples include:

| Category | Actions |
|-----------|---------|
| Navigation | Next Mode, Previous Mode |
| Brightness | Brightness +, Brightness − |
| Display | Display On, Display Off, Flip Display |
| Clock | Toggle 12h Clock, Toggle Day of Week, Toggle Show Date |
| Weather | Toggle Humidity, Toggle Weather Description |
| Countdown | Toggle Countdown |
| Rotation | Toggle Rotation |
| Timer | Pause, Resume, Stop Timer |
| Stopwatch | Start Stopwatch, Stop Stopwatch |
| Pomodoro | Start, Pause, Resume, Stop Pomodoro |
| System | Clear Message, Restart Device |

### Notes

- Up to **4 buttons** can be configured
- Each button supports both a short press and long press action
- Long press threshold defaults to **800ms**
- Buttons use internal pull-ups and should be wired to **GND**
- Duplicate GPIO assignments are automatically prevented
- ESP8266 D-pin labels map to GPIO numbers (for example: **D2 = GPIO4**)
- Avoid using GPIOs already assigned to the MAX7219 display connections

### Example

| Button | GPIO | Short Press | Long Press |
|----------|------|------------|------------|
| Button 1 | GPIO4 | Next Mode | Display Off |
| Button 2 | GPIO5 | Brightness + | Brightness − |
| Button 3 | GPIO12 | Toggle Humidity | Toggle Weather Description |
| Button 4 | GPIO14 | Restart Device | Clear Message |

<summary>⏱️ Alarm, Timer and Stopwatch Feature</summary>
&nbsp;
  
ESPTimeCast includes a full alarm clock feature with day-of-week scheduling, snooze, and a dedicated wake brightness — independent of your normal display rotation.

When the alarm fires, the display takes over completely, showing an inverting clock face until dismissed, snoozed, or automatically silenced after 15 minutes if left unattended.

> If **Clock-only Dimming** is active when the alarm is due to fire, the alarm is skipped entirely for that occurrence — treat this as a "silent hours" window.

### Configuration

1. Open the ESPTimeCast web interface
2. Navigate to **Alarm**
3. Enable the alarm, set a time, and choose which days it repeats on
4. Set a wake brightness and snooze duration
5. Choose the alarm's sound in the **Buzzer** section's event list (Alarm row)

Click **Test Alarm** to preview the full experience — sound, display takeover, and current brightness setting — before trusting it to wake you up.

### Bracket Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `[ALARM]` | Scroll the current alarm schedule as text |
| `[ALARM STOP]` | Dismiss a ringing alarm |
| `[ALARM SNOOZE]` | Snooze a ringing alarm |
| `[ALARM ENABLE]` | Enable the alarm without changing its schedule |
| `[ALARM DISABLE]` | Disable the alarm without changing its schedule |
| `[ALARM TEST]` | Fire the alarm immediately, for testing |
| `[ALARM SET HH:MM]` | Set the time, keep existing days |
| `[ALARM SET HH:MM DAYS]` | Set time and days. `DAYS` is a digit string, `0`=Sun...`6`=Sat, e.g. `12345` = weekdays |
| `[ALARM SET HH:MM DAYS SOUND]` | Also set the alarm's sound (`1`–`3`) |
| `[ALARM SET HH:MM DAYS SOUND VOL]` | Also set the buzzer's global volume (`1`–`10`) |

### `/action` Endpoint

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `alarm_stop` | -- | Dismiss a ringing alarm |
| `alarm_snooze` | -- | Snooze a ringing alarm |
| `alarm_enable` | `0` or `1` (optional) | Enable/disable the alarm schedule. Toggles if no value sent. |
| `alarm_test` | -- or brightness `0`–`15` | Fire the alarm now. Optional value previews at that brightness without saving it. |
| `alarm_set` | `HH:MM[:DAYS[:SOUND[:VOL]]]` | Set schedule, and optionally sound/volume, in one call |

> `alarm_set`'s optional `VOL` field sets the buzzer's **global** volume — it affects every sound the device plays, not just the alarm.

### curl Examples

```bash
# Set a 7:30 AM weekday alarm
curl "http://<device_ip>/action?alarm_set=07:30:12345"

# Set time, days, sound, and volume in one call
curl "http://<device_ip>/action?alarm_set=07:30:12345:3:9"

# Dismiss a ringing alarm
curl "http://<device_ip>/action?alarm_stop"

# Snooze a ringing alarm
curl "http://<device_ip>/action?alarm_snooze"

# Or use message/bracket commands
curl -X POST -d "message=[ALARM SET 07:30 12345]" "http://<device_ip>/action"
curl -X POST -d "message=[ALARM STOP]" "http://<device_ip>/action"
```

### Home Assistant Example

```yaml
alias: Set weekday alarm from HA
action:
  - service: rest_command.esptimecast
    data:
      payload: "alarm_set=07:30:12345"
```

```yaml
alias: Snooze ESPTimeCast alarm from a smart button
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.bedside_button
    to: "single"
action:
  - service: rest_command.esptimecast
    data:
      payload: "alarm_snooze"
```  

### Timer

ESPTimeCast includes a built-in countdown timer that can be triggered via the **Custom Message** field in the Web UI or through **Home Assistant** (or any HTTP client).

Send a custom message using the `[TIMER]` token with your desired duration:

| Format | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `[TIMER xxH]` | `[TIMER 2H]` | 2 hours |
| `[TIMER xxM]` | `[TIMER 30M]` | 30 minutes |
| `[TIMER xxS]` | `[TIMER 90S]` | 90 seconds |
| `[TIMER xxHxxM]` | `[TIMER 1H30M]` | 1 hour 30 minutes |
| `[TIMER xxHxxMxxS]` | `[TIMER 1H30M45S]` | 1 hour 30 minutes 45 seconds |
| `[TIMER xx]` | `[TIMER 5]` | 5 minutes (number only defaults to minutes) |

You can include the timer token in a message:
```
PIZZA IS READY IN [TIMER 20M]
```
> Note: The timer starts immediately and takes over the display.  
> Any message text is ignored while the timer is running.

### Timer Commands

Once a timer is running, you can control it by sending the following as a custom message:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `[TIMER STOP]` or `[TIMER CANCEL]` | Stops the timer and returns to clock |
| `[TIMER PAUSE]` | Pauses the timer at the current time |
| `[TIMER RESUME]` or `[TIMER START]` | Resumes a paused timer |
| `[TIMER RESTART]` | Restarts the timer from its original duration |

### Behavior

- The timer **always overrides the display** while running  
- Only messages sent with `allowInterrupt=0` can override the timer  
- When the timer reaches zero, an alarm animation plays for 5 seconds before returning to the clock  
- Timer state is **not persisted** across reboots  

### Home Assistant Example
```yaml
service: rest_command.esptimecast_message
data:
  message: "[TIMER 20M]"
```
### curl Example
```bash
# Start a 5 second timer
curl -X POST -d "message=[TIMER 5S]" "http://esptimecast.local/set_custom_message"

# Start a timer with a message
curl -X POST -d "message=PIZZA IS READY IN [TIMER 20M]" "http://esptimecast.local/set_custom_message"

# Pause the timer
curl -X POST -d "message=[TIMER PAUSE]" "http://esptimecast.local/set_custom_message"

# Stop the timer
curl -X POST -d "message=[TIMER STOP]" "http://esptimecast.local/set_custom_message"
```

> Replace `esptimecast.local` with your device's IP address if mDNS is not available on your network.

&nbsp;
### Stopwatch

ESPTimeCast also includes a built-in stopwatch, triggered the same way as timers:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `[STOPWATCH]` | Start, pause, or resume the stopwatch |
| `[STOPWATCH RESUME]` | Resume the stopwatch |
| `[STOPWATCH STOP]` | Pause the stopwatch |
| `[STOPWATCH RESTART]` | Restart the stopwatch from 0 and begin running |
| `[STOPWATCH RESET]` | Reset the stopwatch to 0 and remain paused |
| `[STOPWATCH CLEAR]` | Exit the stopwatch and return to the clock |


The stopwatch displays in `MM:SS.cs` format (minutes, seconds, centiseconds), automatically switching to `HH:MM:SS` after one hour.

```bash
# Start a stopwatch
curl -X POST -d "message=[STOPWATCH]" "http://esptimecast.local/action"

# Pause it
curl -X POST -d "message=[STOPWATCH STOP]" "http://esptimecast.local/action"

# Exit it
curl -X POST -d "message=[STOPWATCH CLEAR]" "http://esptimecast.local/action"
```

You can also control the stopwatch via the `/action` endpoint:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `stopwatch` | Start, pause, or resume the stopwatch |
| `stopwatch_resume` | Resume the stopwatch |
| `stopwatch_stop` | Pause the stopwatch |
| `stopwatch_restart` | Restart the stopwatch from 0 and begin running |
| `stopwatch_reset` | Reset the stopwatch to 0 and remain paused |
| `stopwatch_clear` | Exit the stopwatch and return to the clock |

<details>
<summary>🍅 Pomodoro Timer</summary>
&nbsp;

ESPTimeCast includes a built-in Pomodoro timer that follows the classic technique: focused work sessions separated by short breaks, with a longer break after every 4th session.

### How it works

The Pomodoro cycle runs automatically once started — no manual switching required:

1. **Work phase** counts down (default 25 min) with a session progress icon
2. **Short break** counts down (default 5 min) with a clock icon
3. Repeats for 4 sessions — the 4th break is a **long break** (default 15 min)
4. After the long break, the cycle restarts from session 1

The display shows the current session progress using a fill indicator:

| Session | Work Icon | Break Icon |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | ¼ circle | Clock |
| 2 | ½ circle | Clock |
| 3 | ¾ circle | Clock |
| 4 | Full circle | Clock |

### Starting a Pomodoro

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `[POM]` | Start default 25 min work / 5 min break / 15 min long break |
| `[POMODORO]` | Same as `[POM]` |
| `[POMODORO W-B]` | Custom work and break (e.g. `[POMODORO 50-10]`), long break default 15 min|
| `[POMODORO W-B-L]` | Custom work, short break, and long break (e.g. `[POMODORO 25-5-20]`) |

Both work and break durations are capped at **60 minutes**.

### Pomodoro Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `[POM STOP]` or `[POMODORO STOP]` | Stop the Pomodoro and return to clock |
| `[POM RESTART]` or `[POMODORO RESTART]` | Restart from session 1, work phase |
| `[POM PAUSE]` or `[POMODORO PAUSE]`  | Pause the current phase |
| `[POM RESUME]` or `[POMODORO RESUME]`  | Resume a paused phase |

> Starting a `[TIMER]` or `[STOPWATCH]` while a Pomodoro is active will automatically cancel the Pomodoro.

### `/action` Endpoint

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `pom` / `pomodoro_start` | — | Start default 25-5-15 Pomodoro |
| `pomodoro` | e.g. `25-5-15` | Start with custom durations |
| `pomodoro_stop` | — | Stop and return to clock |
| `pomodoro_restart` | — | Restart from session 1 |
| `pomodoro_pause` | — | Pause current phase |
| `pomodoro_resume` | — | Resume paused phase |

### curl Examples

```bash
# Start default Pomodoro
curl "http://esptimecast.local/action?pom"

# Start with custom times
curl "http://esptimecast.local/action?pomodoro=50-10-30"

# Stop
curl "http://esptimecast.local/action?pomodoro_stop"

# Or use message commands
curl -X POST -d "message=[POM]" "http://esptimecast.local/action"
curl -X POST -d "message=[POMODORO 50-10-30]" "http://esptimecast.local/action"
```

### Home Assistant Example

```yaml
alias: Start Pomodoro
action:
  - service: rest_command.esptimecast
    data:
      payload: "pom"
```

<summary>🔊 Buzzer</summary>
&nbsp;

ESPTimeCast supports an optional passive piezo buzzer for audible alerts alongside the visual display — useful for Timer, Countdown, Pomodoro, Stopwatch, and Alarm events, or as a standalone notification sound triggered from Home Assistant.

### Wiring

Connect a passive piezo buzzer between a free GPIO pin and GND.
```
GPIO Pin  ──────────────  Button  ──────────────  GND
```
> Only passive piezo buzzers are supported — active buzzers (with a built-in oscillator) will not respond correctly to the volume/frequency control.

### Configuration

1. Open the ESPTimeCast web interface
2. Navigate to **Buzzer**
3. Select a GPIO pin, enable the buzzer, and set a volume
4. For each event (Countdown, Timer, Pomodoro Work/Break, Stopwatch), choose whether it plays a sound and which one

Changes to the pin and enable toggle apply immediately. Per-event sound choices apply after clicking **Apply**.

### Available Sounds

| ID | Name | Description |
|----|------|--------------|
| 1 | Beep | Single short beep |
| 2 | Chirp | Short ascending chirp |
| 3 | Alarm | Repeating alert pattern |

### `/action` Endpoint

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `buzzer_enable` | `0` or `1` (optional) | Enable/disable the buzzer. Toggles if no value sent. |
| `buzzer_volume` | `1`–`10` | Set and save volume |
| `buzzer_stop` | -- | Immediately silence any currently playing sound |
| `buzzer_event` | `name:sound` or `name:sound:repeat` | Configure an event's sound. `name` is `alarm`, `countdown`, `timer`, `pomodoro_work`, `pomodoro_break`, or `stopwatch`. `sound=0` disables that event. |
| `play_sound` | `id`, `id:volume`, or `id:volume:repeat` | Play a sound once (or looped if `repeat=1`, until `buzzer_stop` is called) |

### curl Examples

```bash
# Enable the buzzer
curl "http://<device_ip>/action?buzzer_enable=1"

# Set volume to 8
curl "http://<device_ip>/action?buzzer_volume=8"

# Play the Chirp sound once at volume 6
curl "http://<device_ip>/action?play_sound=2:6"

# Loop the Alarm sound until stopped
curl "http://<device_ip>/action?play_sound=3:8:1"
curl "http://<device_ip>/action?buzzer_stop"

# Make Timer use the Chirp sound instead of the default
curl "http://<device_ip>/action?buzzer_event=timer:2"
```

### Home Assistant Example

```yaml
alias: Play alert sound on doorbell
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.doorbell
    to: "on"
action:
  - service: rest_command.esptimecast
    data:
      payload: "play_sound=2:8"
```

<details>
<summary>📡 Bridge Mode (YouTube, Instagram, RSS, Nightscout)</summary>
&nbsp;

ESPTimeCast can display live data from external services using the secondary NTP/URL field (`ntpServer2`). The device automatically detects which service to connect to based on the URL you enter, no extra configuration needed. Paste your URL into the field and the device does the rest.  

### 📺 Bridge Mode Display Frequency

By default, **Bridge Mode** is shown once every display rotation. You can change how often it appears by adding the `&show_every=X` parameter to your URL.

| URL | Behaviour |
|-----|-----------|
| `https://your-integration-url.com` | Every rotation (default) |
| `https://your-integration-url.com&show_every=3` | Every 3 rotations |
| `https://your-integration-url.com&show_every=5` | Every 5 rotations |

The `show_every` parameter works with **all Bridge Mode sources**, including **RSS feeds, YouTube subscriber counters, and Nightscout**. The parameter is stripped from the URL before the request is forwarded to the bridge or external service.

### 📺 YouTube Subscriber Counter

Paste any YouTube channel URL or handle into the `ntpServer2` field:

The subscriber count is fetched via a PHP bridge, formatted to fit the display (e.g. `42.1K`, `3.5M`), and shown with the YouTube icon. Data is refreshed every 2 hours.

### 📷 Instagram Follower Counter (Experimental)

Paste any Instagram profile URL into the ntpServer2 field:

`https://www.instagram.com/mfactory.osaka`
`https://instagram.com/mfactory.osaka`

This feature is experimental. Instagram heavily caches public profile information, so follower counts may only update once per day, regardless of the refresh interval.  
The follower count is fetched via a PHP bridge, formatted to fit the display (e.g. `42.1K`, `3.5M`), and shown with the Instagram icon. Data is refreshed every 2 hours.

### 📰 RSS Feed Headlines

Paste any RSS, Atom, or RDF feed URL into the `ntpServer2` field:  

`https://hackaday.com/feed`  
`https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml`  
`https://www.nasa.gov/rss/dyn/breaking_news.rss`  

The title of the most recent article scrolls across the display with the RSS icon. Most standard feed formats are detected automatically — if the URL contains `feed`, `rss`, or `atom`, or ends in `.rss` / `.atom`, it will be picked up correctly.  
RSS feeds are checked every 30 minutes.

### ⚕️ Nightscout Integration

Paste your Nightscout API endpoint into the `ntpServer2` field:  

`https://your-cgm-server/api/v1/entries/current.json?token=xxxxxxxxxxxxx`  

### Unit Selection: mg/dL and mmol/L

By default, glucose is displayed in **mg/dL**. To display in **mmol/L**, add `&mmol=1` to your Nightscout URL:  

`https://your-cgm-server/api/v1/entries/current.json?token=xxxxxxxxxxxxx&mmol=1`  

The conversion (`mg/dL ÷ 18.018`) is handled automatically on the device. No other changes are needed.

- Glucose value and trend arrow are displayed alternately with time and weather
- **Outdated data** (older than 10 minutes) is shown with dimmed characters so you can tell at a glance the reading is stale
- Display duration matches the weather display duration setting
- Data is fetched every 2.5 minutes

### ⚠️ ESP8266 vs ESP32

> **ESP32 is strongly recommended for Nightscout users.**

| | ESP8266 | ESP32 |
|---|---|---|
| Connection | Via PHP bridge (HTTP) | Direct HTTPS |
| Reliability | Good | Excellent |
| Setup | Standard URL | Standard URL |

The ESP8266 connects to Nightscout via an intermediate PHP bridge due to TLS memory constraints. While functional, **ESP32 provides a more stable and direct connection** and is the recommended platform for anyone using Nightscout.

<summary>🧩 Power User Features</summary>
&nbsp;

ESPTimeCast™ includes a few optional "power-user" features that aren't visible in the main interface but can be accessed directly from your browser. These are intended for advanced users who want more control or integration.

#### ⚙️ /factory_reset
Erases all saved configuration data, Wi-Fi credentials, and uptime history.
Used to restore the device to its original state. Only available in **AP mode**.

**Example:**
http://192.168.4.1/factory_reset

#### 💾 /export
Downloads your current configuration (`config.json`) directly from the device.
This is useful for creating backups or migrating settings between devices.

**Example:**
http://your-device-ip/export
The file will download automatically with your saved WiFi credentials (safely masked for security) and all other settings.

#### 📂 /upload
Lets you manually upload a configuration file (`config.json`) to the device.
Perfect for restoring a backup or quickly switching between setups.

**Usage:**
1. Go to
http://your-device-ip/upload
2. Select your edited or backup `config.json` file.
3. The device will confirm the upload and automatically reboot with the new configuration.

> *Tip:* You can export → edit the file on your computer → re-upload to test new settings without using the web interface.

#### ⚠️ Notes
- These features are optional and hidden from the main interface to avoid clutter.
- `/upload` and `/export` are intentionally unlinked from the UI to prevent accidental access.
- Always verify your WiFi credentials and tokens before uploading edited configurations.

<summary>📺 How the Display Works</summary>
&nbsp;

**ESPTimeCast™** automatically switches between two display modes: Clock and Weather.
If "Show Weather Description" is enabled, a third mode (Description) will display with a duration of 3 seconds, if the description is too long to fit on the display the description will scroll from right to left once.

What you see on the LED matrix depends on whether the device has successfully fetched the current time (via NTP) and weather (via OpenWeatherMap).  
The following table summarizes what will appear on the display in each scenario:

| Display Mode | 🕒 NTP Time | 🌦️ Weather Data | 📺 Display Output                              |
|:------------:|:----------:|:--------------:|:--------------------------------------------|
| **Clock**    | ✅ Yes      | —              | 🗓️ Day Icon + ⏰ Time (e.g. `@ 14:53`)           |
| **Clock**    | ❌ No       | —              |  `! NTP` (NTP sync failed)               |
| **Weather**  | —          | ✅ Yes         | 🌡️ Temperature (e.g. `23ºC`)                |
| **Weather**  | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No          | 🗓️ Day Icon + ⏰ Time (e.g. `@ 14:53`)           |
| **Weather**  | ❌ No       | ❌ No          |  `! TEMP` (no weather or time data)       |

#### How it works:

- The display automatically alternates between **Clock** and **Weather** modes (the duration for each is configurable).
- If "Show Weather Description" is enabled a third mode **Description** will display after the **Weather** display with a duration of 3 seconds.
- In **Clock** mode, if NTP time is available, you’ll see the current time plus a unique day-of-week icon. If NTP is not available, you'll see `! NTP`.
- In **Weather** mode, if weather is available, you’ll see the temperature (like `23ºC`). If weather is not available but time is, it falls back to showing the clock. If neither is available, you’ll see `! TEMP`.
- All status/error messages (`! NTP`, `! TEMP`) are big icons shown on the display.

**Legend:**
- 🗓️ **Day Icon**: Custom symbol for day of week (`@`, `=`, etc.)
- ⏰ **Time**: Current time (HH:MM)
- 🌡️ **Temperature**: Weather from OpenWeatherMap
- ✅ **Yes**: Data available
- ❌ **No**: Data not available
- — : Value does not affect this mode
