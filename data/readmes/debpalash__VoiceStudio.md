<a id="install"></a>

## Install

| Platform | Package | Guide |
|---|---|---|
| macOS 13.3+ | DMG, Apple Silicon | [Install on macOS](docs/install/macos.md) |
| Windows 10/11 | MSI, x64 | [Install on Windows](docs/install/windows.md) |
| Linux | AppImage, x86_64 with glibc 2.39+ | [Install on Linux](docs/install/linux.md) |
| Docker | CUDA, ROCm, or CPU | [Run with Docker](docs/install/docker.md) |

Download packages from the [latest release](https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/releases/latest). First launch creates a managed Python environment and downloads the default model. Later launches reuse both.

> [!NOTE]
> On macOS, first launch needs a one-time right-click → **Open** approval. Intel Macs cannot run the local Python backend; use a [remote backend](docs/install/macos.md) instead.

### First voice

1. Launch VoiceStudio and open **Voice Cloning**.
2. Add a clean voice sample. Three seconds works; 5–15 seconds usually gives a better prompt.
3. Enter text, choose a language, then select **Generate**.

### Run from source

Install the [development prerequisites](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-setup), then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio.git
cd VoiceStudio
bun install
bun run desktop
```

Use `bun run dev` for the browser UI. See [Contributing](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for services, tests, and platform packages.

### If setup fails

- Run **Settings → About → Run self-check** or `uv run python backend/main.py --diagnose --deep`.
- Check [install troubleshooting](docs/install/troubleshooting.md).
- Save a scrubbed diagnostic bundle from the app when opening an issue.
- For slow generation, compare [measured benchmarks](docs/benchmarks.md) and [performance settings](docs/performance.md).

<a id="comparison"></a>

## Comparison

VoiceStudio trades managed cloud compute for local control. This is the practical difference:

| | **VoiceStudio** | **Typical hosted voice service** |
|---|---|---|
| **Best fit** | Private, offline, self-hosted, or high-volume work | Fast setup without local model management |
| **Data path** | Local by default; remote features are opt-in | Audio and text are processed by the provider |
| **Cost model** | Free software; you supply the hardware | Subscription, credits, or metered API use |
| **Setup** | Install the app and model weights | Create an account and use the web app or API |
| **Performance** | Depends on your engine and hardware | Provider manages compute and scaling |
| **Offline use** | Yes, after required models are installed | Usually requires a network connection |
| **Customization** | Source, engines, models, API, and routing are open | Limited to provider options |
| **Maintenance** | You manage updates, disk, and compute | Provider manages infrastructure |

<a id="requirements"></a>

## Requirements

Requirements vary by engine. These values cover the default local workflow.

| | **Minimum** | **Recommended** |
|---|---|---|
| **OS** | Windows 10 x64 · macOS 13.3 Apple Silicon · Linux x86_64 with glibc 2.39+ | Current supported OS release |
| **RAM** | 8 GB | 16 GB+ |
| **Disk** | 10 GB free | 20 GB+ SSD |
| **GPU** | Optional; CPU mode is supported | NVIDIA CUDA or Apple Silicon |
| **VRAM** | 4 GB when using a GPU | 8 GB+; large optional engines need more |
| **Python from source** | 3.11+ | 3.11–3.12 |

ROCm is Linux-only and opt-in. Windows AMD/Ryzen AI uses CPU. Systems with limited VRAM offload work to CPU when required. See [performance](docs/performance.md), [benchmarks](docs/benchmarks.md), and [engine disk usage](docs/engines/disk-usage.md).

<a id="engines"></a>

## Engines

Engine support is capability-specific. Check cloning, language, platform, memory, and license before choosing one. Full setup guides: [docs/engines](docs/engines/README.md).

¹ IndexTTS 2.5 requires a separate written Bilibili license above 100 million monthly active users or RMB 1 billion annual revenue. Review the [model license](https://huggingface.co/IndexTeam/IndexTTS-2.5/blob/main/LICENSE).

² PocketTTS shows its gated-access and CC-BY-4.0 terms before first use.

Clone-less engines cannot preserve a reference speaker in dubbing or pinned-voice batch jobs. VoiceStudio rejects those jobs instead of silently changing engines. Heavy engines have separate memory and platform limits; check their engine guide first.

### Speech to text

| Engine | ID | Languages | Best fit |
|---|---|:---:|---|
| **WhisperX** (default) | `whisperx` | ~100 | Dubbing, subtitles, word-level timing |
| **Faster-Whisper** | `faster-whisper` | ~100 | General cross-platform transcription |
| **Faster-Whisper (isolated)** | `faster-whisper-isolated` | ~100 | Crash-isolated batch transcription |
| **MLX Whisper** | `mlx-whisper` | ~100 | Apple Silicon |
| **PyTorch Whisper** | `pytorch-whisper` | ~100 | CUDA, MPS, and CPU fallback |
| **Parakeet TDT** | `nemo-parakeet` | English + 25 EU | Fast CPU/CUDA transcription |
| **Parakeet TDT v3 (MLX)** | `parakeet-mlx` | 25 EU | Apple Silicon dictation and word timestamps |
| **Moonshine** | `moonshine` | English | Low-power, low-latency ONNX |
| **FunASR** | `funasr` | 50+ | VAD and inline diarization |
| **sherpa-onnx** (live dictation) | `sherpa-onnx-asr` | Model-dependent | Streaming CPU dictation |
| **OpenAI-compatible** ⚠️ remote | `openai-compat-asr` | Server-dependent | Qwen3-ASR or another compatible endpoint; audio leaves the machine |

WhisperX and Faster-Whisper retry with `int8` when efficient `float16` is unavailable. Pin `ASR_COMPUTE_TYPE=int8` or `float32` only if automatic selection still fails.

## Architecture

```text
Tauri v2 desktop shell (Rust)
        │ IPC
React + Vite UI
        │ HTTP · SSE · WebSocket on localhost:3900
FastAPI backend
        ├── TTS / ASR engine registries
        ├── dubbing / audio / long-form pipelines
        ├── OpenAI-compatible API and MCP server
        └── SQLite + Alembic → omnivoice_data/
```

| Layer | Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Desktop shell | `frontend/src-tauri/` | Window lifecycle, tray, shortcuts, updater, sidecar bootstrap |
| Frontend | `frontend/src/` | React UI, Zustand state, API and event clients, i18n |
| API | `backend/api/` | REST routes, schemas, auth boundaries, streaming |
| Core services | `backend/services/` | Generation, dubbing, audio processing, persistence |
| Engines | `backend/engines/` | Isolated and optional engine adapters |
| Worker system | `backend/worker/` | Authenticated remote compute and job transport |
| Data | `omnivoice_data/` | Projects, voices, settings, logs, and SQLite state |
| Delivery | `scripts/`, `deploy/`, `.github/workflows/` | Development, packaging, containers, releases, CI |

### Network boundary

- The desktop talks to a loopback-only backend on `localhost:3900`.
- Loopback API calls need no server key. Remote access requires a share PIN or API key.
- Remote workers and OpenAI-compatible ASR are opt-in. The UI identifies when audio leaves the machine.
- Analytics is off until consent. If enabled, it sends allowlisted, content-free usage metadata—not text, audio, file names, or projects.

<a id="api"></a>

## OpenAI-compatible API

Point an OpenAI-compatible audio client at the local backend:

```diff
- base_url="https://api.openai.com/v1"
+ base_url="http://localhost:3900/v1"
```

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /v1/audio/speech` | TTS to `mp3`, `opus`, `aac`, `flac`, `wav`, or `pcm`; select a profile with `voice` and an engine with `model` |
| `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` | STT to `json`, `text`, `verbose_json`, `srt`, or `vtt` |
| `GET /v1/audio/voices` | List local voice profiles and engines |

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:3900/v1", api_key="local")

with client.audio.speech.with_streaming_response.create(
    model="tts-1",
    voice="<profile-id>",
    input="Made on my own hardware.",
    response_format="wav",
) as response:
    response.stream_to_file("speech.wav")
```

The full API reference is in **Settings → OpenAPI Reference**. For LAN, Tailscale, or proxy access, read [API authentication](docs/api-auth.md) before exposing the backend.

### Agent skills

Install the VoiceStudio skills for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and other [skills.sh](https://skills.sh)-compatible agents:

```bash
npx skills add debpalash/omnivoice-studio
```

- `omnivoice`: synthesize speech and transcribe audio through local VoiceStudio.
- `oss-maintainer`: the repository's open-source maintenance workflow.

### Google Colab

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/debpalash/VoiceStudio/blob/main/notebooks/OmniVoice_Studio_Colab.ipynb)

The [notebook](notebooks/OmniVoice_Studio_Colab.ipynb) runs the app and web UI on a Colab GPU. Colab is remote compute, so uploaded audio and project data do not remain local to your machine.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Does it work on Apple Silicon and Intel Macs?</strong></summary>

Apple Silicon is supported with MPS and MLX options. Intel Macs cannot run the local backend because current PyTorch wheels are unavailable; they can connect to a remote backend. See [macOS installation](docs/install/macos.md).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How much VRAM do I need?</strong></summary>

A GPU is optional. Use 4 GB VRAM as the minimum for accelerated work and 8 GB+ for the default multi-stage workflow. Large optional engines can require 12–16 GB or more. Check the [benchmarks](docs/benchmarks.md) and engine guide.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why does a longer reference clip not always improve the clone?</strong></summary>

Cloning is zero-shot: the clip is a prompt, not training data. Use 5–15 seconds of one speaker, close to the microphone, without music, noise, or reverb. Match the tone and pace you want in the output. For training, see [data preparation](docs/data_preparation.md) and [training](docs/training.md).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use generated audio commercially?</strong></summary>

Yes under VoiceStudio's AGPL-3.0 terms. Optional engines and model weights may use different licenses; review the selected engine's license before commercial use.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does VoiceStudio collect data?</strong></summary>

Not unless you opt in. Analytics is off by default and skipping consent keeps it off. When enabled, the app sends allowlisted, content-free usage metadata. Text, audio, file names, voices, and projects are excluded. Change this at **Settings → Privacy**.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I remove VoiceStudio and its data?</strong></summary>

Use `scripts/uninstall.sh` on macOS/Linux or `scripts\uninstall.ps1` on Windows. Both show a dry run before deletion. See the [uninstall guide](docs/install/uninstall.md) for every path.
