## 🆕 What's New

### 🚀 v2.0.0 highlights (new)

v2.0 ships the complete Chatterbox family on every major GPU stack behind one OpenAI-compatible API and Web UI. The headline themes:

- **DGX Spark / sm_121 support** via the new `docker-compose-cu130.yml` (CUDA 13.0, PyTorch 2.10). RTX 30/40/50 keep using cu121 / cu128.
- **AMD Strix Halo support** via `docker-compose-strixhalo.yml` (ROCm 7.2, `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.0.0`).
- **Streaming `/tts` endpoint** — opt-in `stream: true` parameter returns a `StreamingResponse` that flushes WAV bytes per chunk with 20 ms crossfades. Default behavior unchanged.
- **Voice conditioning cache** — repeated requests against the same reference voice skip re-encoding. Real latency win for batch / OpenAI-endpoint workflows.
- **Opt-in BF16 inference** — `TTS_BF16=on` (or `=auto`) converts T3 to bfloat16 and runs under autocast for ~40% throughput on bf16-capable GPUs. Default `off` to preserve existing behavior on upgrade.
- **HTTPS / SSL** — optional `ssl_certfile` and `ssl_keyfile` in `config.yaml` for direct HTTPS without a reverse proxy.
- **Security: CWE-22 path traversal fixed** on `/tts` and `/v1/audio/speech` voice file parameters. Traversal attempts return HTTP 400.
- **New endpoints** — `/api/unload` (release GPU memory without restart) and `/v1/audio/voices` (OpenAI-compatible voice listing).
- **Dynamic language selector** — the UI populates the language dropdown from `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` exposed by the multilingual engine.
- **Chunker fix** — stray dashes in narrative text no longer get treated as bullet items that swallow the rest of the paragraph (#144).

See the [v2.0.0 release notes](https://github.com/devnen/Chatterbox-TTS-Server/releases/tag/v2.0.0) for the full list with contributor credits.

### 📦 Portable Mode for Windows (new)

- The launcher now offers **Portable Mode** for all Windows users during first-time setup — selected by default.
- Creates a fully self-contained installation: the entire project folder can be **copied to a USB drive**, **zipped and shared**, or **moved anywhere** on the filesystem.
- The recipient just double-clicks `start.bat` — **no Python installation required** on the target machine.
- Works with any system Python 3.10+, but the embedded runtime always uses Python 3.10 — the only fully supported version. If your system Python is 3.11+, Portable Mode is the easiest way to avoid dependency issues on Windows.
- Use `--portable` to skip the prompt and install in portable mode directly, or `--no-portable` for a standard virtual environment.
- Linux and macOS use standard virtual environments with Python 3.10. Portable Mode is not available on these platforms, so Python 3.10 must be installed on the system.

### 🌍 Chatterbox Multilingual support (new)

- Added full support for **Chatterbox Multilingual**, completing support for all three models in Resemble AI's Chatterbox family.
- Multilingual brings **23-language support** including Arabic, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Swahili, and Turkish.
- Built on the same **0.5B-parameter architecture** as the original Chatterbox with emotion exaggeration control and zero-shot voice cloning.
- Perfect for international projects, multilingual audiobooks, and voice agents serving global audiences.

### ⚡ Chatterbox‑Turbo support (new)

- Added full support for **Chatterbox‑Turbo**, Resemble AI's latest efficiency-focused Chatterbox model.
- Turbo is built on a **streamlined 350M‑parameter architecture**, designed to use less compute/VRAM while keeping high-fidelity output.
- Turbo distills the speech-token-to-mel "audio diffusion decoder" from **10 steps → 1 step**, removing a major inference bottleneck.
- Resemble positions Turbo for real-time/agent workflows and highlights significantly faster-than-real-time performance on GPU (performance varies by hardware/settings).

### 🔁 Hot‑swappable TTS engines (UI)

- Added a new **engine selector** dropdown at the top of the Web UI.
- Instantly hot-swap between **Original Chatterbox**, **Chatterbox Multilingual**, and **Chatterbox‑Turbo**; the backend auto-loads the selected engine.
- All three models are **hot-swappable**—simply select from the dropdown and the backend automatically loads your choice without requiring restarts or configuration changes.
- All UI + API requests route through the active engine so you can A/B test quality, language support, and latency without changing client code.

### 🎭 Paralinguistic tags (Turbo)

- Turbo adds **native paralinguistic tags** you can write directly into your text, e.g. `…calling you back [chuckle]…`.
- Supported tags include `[laugh]`, `[cough]`, and `[chuckle]`, plus text-based prompting for reactions like sigh, gasp, and cough.
- Added **new presets** in `ui/presets.yaml` demonstrating paralinguistic prompting for agent-style scripts and expressive reads.

### ✅ Original Chatterbox remains first‑class

- The original Chatterbox model remains available, with support for high quality English language output, a **0.5B LLaMA backbone**, **emotion exaggeration control**, and training on **0.5M hours** of cleaned data.

### 🎯 Complete Chatterbox family support

**You now have access to the entire Chatterbox lineup:**
- **Original Chatterbox** — High-quality English output with emotion control (0.5B parameters, 0.5M hours training data)
- **Chatterbox Multilingual** — 23-language support with voice cloning and emotion control (0.5B parameters)
- **Chatterbox Turbo** — Fastest inference with paralinguistic tags like `[laugh]` and `[cough]` (350M parameters, 1-step diffusion)

**Switching models is effortless:** Simply select your preferred model from the engine selector dropdown at the top of the Web UI. No restarts, no configuration changes required—just instant hot-swapping to test quality, speed, and language support across the complete Chatterbox family.

### 🖥️ Installation fixes across all platforms

- **All platforms:** Chatterbox is now installed with `--no-deps` across all installation paths (CPU, NVIDIA, cu128, ROCm). This eliminates ONNX source build failures, torch version conflicts, and CMake errors that affected many users. Chatterbox's dependencies (conformer, diffusers, transformers, s3tokenizer, etc.) are now listed explicitly in each requirements file with `onnx==1.16.0` pinned to guarantee pre-built wheels.
- **Apple Silicon / MPS:** Fixed Turbo model crash ("Cannot convert a MPS Tensor to float64 dtype") by forcing float32 in s3tokenizer and voice_encoder. Fix applied in the chatterbox-v2 fork and also as an automatic post-install patch in `start.py` for users of other chatterbox versions. Thanks to @jonas3245 (#93).
- **Docker CPU:** New lightweight `Dockerfile.cpu` based on `python:3.10-slim` instead of the 4GB+ NVIDIA CUDA base image. `docker-compose-cpu.yml` now uses this smaller image. Removed deprecated `version` tags from all docker-compose files.
- **config.yaml:** Default device changed from `cuda` to `auto` for correct auto-detection on all hardware (CUDA, MPS, CPU).
- **Python version:** **Python 3.10 is required** — it is the only version with pre-built wheels for all dependencies (torch, torchvision, ONNX). Python 3.11+ may fail due to missing wheels. The Windows launcher's Portable Mode handles this automatically by using an embedded Python 3.10 runtime.
- **Blackwell (CUDA 12.8):** Fixed `requirements-nvidia-cu128.txt` to properly install PyTorch 2.9.0 with CUDA 12.8 (`sm_120` support) for RTX 5060 Ti, 5070, 5070 Ti, 5080, and 5090 GPUs. The `Dockerfile.cu128` now correctly installs chatterbox with `--no-deps` to prevent PyTorch downgrade.
- **AMD ROCm:** Fixed ROCm installation by switching to PyTorch's official ROCm 6.1 wheel index (`torch==2.5.1+rocm6.1`), which resolves the previous `torch==2.6.0` / `torchaudio==2.5.1` version conflict. A new `requirements-rocm-init.txt` installs the ROCm PyTorch stack before other dependencies. Both `Dockerfile.rocm` and `start.py` now use a two-step install to prevent pip from replacing ROCm torch wheels with CPU-only versions.
- Thanks to community contributors in issues #20, #23, #44, #58, #64, #79, #89, #92, #93, #98, #105, #107, #109, #113, #114, #121, and #122 for testing and reporting solutions.

### 🧰 Automated launcher + easy updates

- New **Automated Launcher** (Windows + Linux) that creates/activates a venv, installs the right dependencies, downloads model files, starts the server, and opens the Web UI.
- Easy maintenance commands:
  - `--upgrade` to update code + dependencies.
  - `--reinstall` for a clean reinstall when environments get messy.

1. The launcher checks your Python installation (3.10 required; 3.10+ needed to bootstrap Portable Mode on Windows)
2. **On Windows:** Offers **Portable Mode** (recommended) — creates a fully self-contained, movable installation. See [Portable Mode](#-portable-mode-windows) for details. Use `--portable` to skip this prompt or `--no-portable` for a standard virtual environment.
3. Sets up the Python environment (portable or standard virtual environment)
4. Detects your GPU hardware (NVIDIA, AMD, or CPU-only)
5. Shows an installation menu with recommended option pre-selected:

```

```bash
# Windows
start.bat

# Linux/macOS
./start.sh
```

The launcher detects the existing installation and starts the server directly without reinstalling.

---

### 📦 Portable Mode (Windows)

On Windows, the launcher offers **Portable Mode** — a fully self-contained installation where the entire project folder, including its own private Python runtime and all dependencies, lives in one place. Unlike standard Python virtual environments (which use hardcoded absolute paths and break when moved), the portable installation uses only relative paths and works from any location.

#### What You Can Do With It

Once the first-time setup completes, the entire project folder can be:

*   **Copied to a different directory** on the same machine — it still works.
*   **Copied to a USB drive** and run on another Windows PC — no Python needed on that machine.
*   **Zipped up and shared** with someone else — they unzip, double-click `start.bat`, and it runs.
*   **Moved anywhere** on the filesystem without breaking anything.

The recipient doesn't need Python installed, doesn't need to run any setup, and doesn't need an internet connection to launch the server (see note about models below).

#### First Run vs. Subsequent Runs

*   **First run:** The launcher sets up the portable Python environment and installs all dependencies (PyTorch, CUDA libraries, etc.). This requires an internet connection and takes a few minutes. The resulting folder will be several GB due to PyTorch and GPU libraries.
*   **Subsequent runs:** The launcher detects the existing portable environment and starts the server in seconds. No internet needed, no setup repeated.

#### Note About Model Downloads

The TTS models (~2+ GB) are downloaded from Hugging Face Hub into a **separate cache folder** the first time the server starts on any machine. This is a one-time download per machine, independent of the portable application folder.

If you're sharing a portable installation, the recipient will need an internet connection for this initial model download on their first run. To pre-include models in the portable package, you can set the `model_cache` path in `config.yaml` to a folder inside the project directory, then include it when sharing.

#### When Does the Portable Prompt Appear?

During first-time setup on Windows, the launcher offers a choice:

*   **Portable Mode** (recommended, default): Creates a self-contained `python_embedded/` environment inside the project folder using Python 3.10. Any system Python 3.10+ can bootstrap this process, but the embedded runtime is always Python 3.10.
*   **Standard installation**: Uses a regular Python virtual environment (`venv/`). **Requires system Python 3.10** — Python 3.11+ will fail due to missing pre-built wheels for key dependencies.

If your system Python is 3.11+, **Portable Mode is required on Windows** because it uses an embedded Python 3.10 runtime, bypassing the dependency issues entirely.

You can skip the prompt entirely with command-line flags:
*   `python start.py --portable` — go straight to portable mode
*   `python start.py --no-portable` — go straight to standard venv
*   `python start.py --reinstall --portable` — switch an existing installation to portable mode

#### Not Available on Linux / macOS

Portable Mode is Windows-specific. On Linux and macOS, the standard virtual environment is used. Python 3.10 is required on all platforms — the dependency compatibility issues (missing wheels for torchvision, ONNX) affect all operating systems, not just Windows.

#### GPU Drivers Still Required

Portable Mode includes Python and all Python packages, but **GPU drivers are not included**. If the target machine has an NVIDIA GPU and you want GPU acceleration, the appropriate NVIDIA drivers must be installed on that machine. CPU mode works without any drivers.

<details>
<summary><strong>🔧 Technical Details (for developers/contributors)</strong></summary>

**How it works under the hood:**

*   Portable Mode uses the official **CPython 3.10.11 embeddable distribution** from python.org — a minimal, self-contained Python runtime (~8 MB before dependencies are installed).
*   The embeddable distribution's `python310._pth` file is patched to use **relative paths** (`.`, `..`, `Lib\site-packages`). The `..` entry resolves to the project root since `python_embedded/` is always one level deep. This is what makes portability work — no absolute paths are written anywhere.
*   There is no virtual environment activation step. No `activate.bat`, no `activate.ps1`, no hardcoded paths. The launcher simply runs `python_embedded/python.exe` directly.
*   The launcher bootstraps `pip` via `get-pip.py`, explicitly installs `setuptools` (needed by the `perth` watermarking library at runtime), generates a `sitecustomize.py` for DLL search path configuration, and patches the TTS engine's watermarker initialization for resilience.
*   The `start.bat` batch file finds any system Python to launch `start.py`, which then detects the existing `python_embedded/` directory and uses it — regardless of which system Python version invoked the launcher.

### 📋 Manual Installation

For users who prefer manual control over the installation process.

**2. Create a Python Virtual Environment**

Using a virtual environment is crucial to avoid conflicts with other projects.

*   **Windows (PowerShell):**
    ```powershell
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

*   **Linux (Bash):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    Your command prompt should now start with `(venv)`.

**3. Choose Your Installation Path**

Pick one of the following commands based on your hardware. This single command will install all necessary dependencies with compatible versions.

---

### **Option 1: CPU-Only Installation**

This is the most straightforward option and works on any machine without a compatible GPU.

```bash
# Make sure your (venv) is active
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install --no-deps git+https://github.com/devnen/chatterbox-v2.git@master
```

<details>
<summary><strong>💡 How This Works</strong></summary>
The `requirements.txt` file installs CPU PyTorch and all server dependencies. Chatterbox is installed separately with `--no-deps` to prevent pip from pulling in conflicting torch versions or triggering ONNX source builds.
</details>

---

### **Option 2: NVIDIA GPU Installation (CUDA 12.1)**

For users with NVIDIA GPUs. This provides the best performance for RTX 20/30/40 series.

**Prerequisite:** Ensure you have the latest NVIDIA drivers installed. **Python 3.10 required** (3.11+ is not supported — pre-built wheels for torchvision and ONNX are unavailable).

```bash
# Make sure your (venv) is active
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements-nvidia.txt
pip install --no-deps git+https://github.com/devnen/chatterbox-v2.git@master
```

**After installation, verify that PyTorch can see your GPU:**
```bash
python -c "import torch; print(f'PyTorch version: {torch.__version__}'); print(f'CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}'); print(f'Device name: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0) if torch.cuda.is_available() else None}')"
```
If `CUDA available:` shows `True`, your setup is correct!

<details>
<summary><strong>💡 How This Works</strong></summary>
The `requirements-nvidia.txt` file installs PyTorch with CUDA 12.1 support plus all server dependencies. Chatterbox is installed separately with `--no-deps` to prevent pip from downgrading the CUDA torch to a CPU version or triggering ONNX source builds.
</details>

---

### **Option 2b: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA 12.8 (RTX 5090 / Blackwell)**

> **Note:** Only use this if you have a **Blackwell-based GPU** (RTX 5060 Ti, 5070, 5070 Ti, 5080, 5090). For RTX 2000/3000/4000 series, use Option 2 above.

For users with NVIDIA Blackwell architecture GPUs that require CUDA 12.8 and sm_120 support.

**Prerequisites:**
- NVIDIA RTX 5060 Ti, 5070, 5070 Ti, 5080, 5090 or other Blackwell-based GPU
- CUDA 12.8+ drivers (driver version 570+)

**Using Docker (Recommended for RTX 5090):**
```bash
# Build and start with CUDA 12.8 support
docker compose -f docker-compose-cu128.yml up -d

# Access the web UI at http://localhost:8004
```

**Manual Installation:**
```bash
# Make sure your (venv) is active
pip install --upgrade pip

# Step 1: Install dependencies with PyTorch 2.9.0+cu128 (includes sm_120 support)
pip install -r requirements-nvidia-cu128.txt

# Step 2: Install chatterbox without dependencies (prevents PyTorch downgrade)
pip install --no-deps git+https://github.com/devnen/chatterbox-v2.git@master
```

⚠️ **Critical:** The `--no-deps` flag is required to prevent PyTorch from being downgraded to a version that doesn't support Blackwell GPUs.

**After installation, verify that PyTorch supports sm_120:**
```bash
python -c "import torch; print(f'PyTorch: {torch.__version__}'); print(f'CUDA: {torch.cuda.is_available()}'); print(f'GPU: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}'); print(f'Architectures: {torch.cuda.get_arch_list()}')"
```

You should see `sm_120` in the architectures list!

<details>
<summary><strong>💡 Why CUDA 12.8?</strong></summary>

NVIDIA's Blackwell GPUs (RTX 5060 Ti, 5070, 5070 Ti, 5080, 5090) use compute capability **sm_120**. PyTorch 2.9.0 with CUDA 12.8 includes support for this architecture. Earlier versions (including CUDA 12.1) will fail with the error: `CUDA error: no kernel image is available for execution on the device`.

See [README_CUDA128.md](README_CUDA128.md) for detailed setup instructions and troubleshooting.
</details>

---

### **Option 2c: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA 13.0 (DGX Spark / sm_121)**

> **Note:** Use this for **NVIDIA DGX Spark / GB10** hardware (compute capability `sm_121`). RTX 5090 stays on cu128 (Option 2b); RTX 30/40 stays on cu121 (Option 2).

For users on the very latest NVIDIA stack who need CUDA 13.0 and PyTorch 2.10.

**Prerequisites:**
- NVIDIA DGX Spark / GB10 or other sm_121-capable hardware
- CUDA 13.0+ drivers (driver version 580+)

**Using Docker (recommended):**
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-cu130.yml up -d

# Access the web UI at http://localhost:8004
```

The `Dockerfile.cu130` installs PyTorch 2.10.0+cu130 with chatterbox-v2 via `--no-deps` so PyTorch is not downgraded.

---

### **Option 3: AMD GPU Installation (ROCm)**

For users with modern, ROCm-compatible AMD GPUs.

**Prerequisite:** Ensure you have the latest ROCm drivers installed on a Linux system.

```bash
# Make sure your (venv) is active
pip install --upgrade pip

# Step 1: Install ROCm PyTorch stack first
pip install -r requirements-rocm-init.txt

# Step 2: Install remaining dependencies
pip install -r requirements-rocm.txt

# Step 3: Install chatterbox without dependencies (prevents ROCm torch overwrite)
pip install --no-deps git+https://github.com/devnen/chatterbox-v2.git@master
```

⚠️ **Critical:** The `--no-deps` flag on chatterbox-tts is required to prevent pip from replacing the ROCm PyTorch wheels with CPU-only versions from PyPI. The `start.py` launcher handles this automatically.

**After installation, verify that PyTorch can see your GPU:**
```bash
python -c "import torch; print(f'PyTorch version: {torch.__version__}'); print(f'ROCm available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}'); print(f'Device name: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0) if torch.cuda.is_available() else None}')"
```
If `ROCm available:` shows `True`, your setup is correct!

<details>
<summary><strong>💡 How This Works</strong></summary>

ROCm installation uses a two-step process:
1. `requirements-rocm-init.txt` installs PyTorch from the official ROCm 6.1 wheel index (`torch==2.5.1+rocm6.1`), ensuring you get AMD GPU-accelerated builds.
2. `requirements-rocm.txt` installs remaining server dependencies without touching PyTorch.
3. Chatterbox is installed with `--no-deps` to prevent pip's dependency resolver from replacing the ROCm torch with a CPU-only version.

**For APU/iGPU users:** If you encounter "HIP error: invalid device function", you may need to set `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION`. See [AMD ROCm Support Details](#amd-rocm-support-details) below.
</details>

---

### **Option 4: Apple Silicon (MPS) Installation**

For users with Apple Silicon Macs (M1, M2, M3, M4, etc.).

**Prerequisite:** Ensure you have macOS 12.3 or later for MPS support.

**Step 1: Install PyTorch with MPS support first**
```bash
# Make sure your (venv) is active
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

**Step 2: Configure the server to use MPS**
Update your `config.yaml` to use MPS instead of CUDA:
```yaml
tts_engine:
  device: mps  # Changed from 'cuda' to 'mps'
```

**Step 3: Install remaining dependencies**
```bash
# Install chatterbox-tts without its dependencies to avoid conflicts
pip install --no-deps git+https://github.com/devnen/chatterbox-v2.git@master

# Install core server dependencies
pip install fastapi 'uvicorn[standard]' librosa safetensors soundfile pydub audiotsm praat-parselmouth python-multipart requests aiofiles PyYAML watchdog unidecode inflect tqdm

# Install missing chatterbox dependencies
pip install conformer==0.3.2 diffusers==0.29.0 resemble-perth==1.0.1 transformers==4.46.3

# Install s3tokenizer without its problematic dependencies
pip install --no-deps s3tokenizer

# Install a compatible version of ONNX and audio codec
pip install onnx==1.16.0 descript-audio-codec
```

**After installation, verify that PyTorch can see your GPU:**
```bash
python -c "import torch; print(f'PyTorch version: {torch.__version__}'); print(f'MPS available: {torch.backends.mps.is_available()}'); print(f'Device will use: {\"mps\" if torch.backends.mps.is_available() else \"cpu\"}')"
```
If `MPS available:` shows `True`, your setup is correct!

<details>
<summary><strong>💡 Why This Process Is Different</strong></summary>
Apple Silicon requires a specific installation sequence due to dependency conflicts between the pinned PyTorch versions in chatterbox-tts and the latest PyTorch versions that support MPS. By installing PyTorch first with MPS support, then carefully installing dependencies while avoiding version conflicts, we ensure MPS acceleration works properly. The server's automatic device detection will use MPS when configured and available.
</details>
```

---

### **Option 5: AMD Strix Halo (Ryzen AI MAX+) Installation**

> **Note:** Use this for AMD **Strix Halo** APUs (Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 / "Ryzen AI Max" with integrated Radeon 8060S, GFX 11.5.0). Standard discrete Radeon GPUs use Option 3 (ROCm).

**Prerequisites:**
- AMD Strix Halo APU on Linux
- ROCm 7.2+ stack installed on the host

**Using Docker (recommended):**
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-strixhalo.yml up -d

# Access the web UI at http://localhost:8004
```

The compose file sets `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.0.0` and `HSA_XNACK=1` so the ROCm 7.2 wheels work on Strix Halo's GFX 11.5.0 silicon, and enables `TTS_BF16=on` for the throughput win on this hardware.

---

### **Option 6: AMD RDNA4 (RX 9070 / RX 9070 XT / R9700) Installation**

> **Note:** For AMD **RDNA4 discrete GPUs** (RX 9070, RX 9070 XT, Radeon AI PRO R9700, gfx1201).
> ROCm 6.1 wheels do **not** support gfx1201 — ROCm 7.2 is required. Standard discrete Radeon GPUs (RX 6000/7000) use Option 3.

**Prerequisites:**
- AMD RDNA4 GPU (RX 9070 / 9070 XT / R9700) on Linux
- ROCm 7.2+ stack installed on the host (see [ROCm install guide](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/))
- User in `video` and `render` groups: `sudo usermod -aG video,render $USER`

**Using Docker (recommended):**
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-rdna4.yml up -d

# Access the web UI at http://localhost:8004
```

The compose file sets `ROCBLAS_USE_HIPBLASLT=0` (required for stability on gfx1201) and enables `TTS_BF16=on` for throughput gain. gfx1201 is natively supported by ROCm 7.0+ — no `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION` needed.

---

*Prefer local installation? Continue reading below for full setup instructions.*

## ⚙️ Configuration

The server relies exclusively on `config.yaml` for runtime configuration.

*   **`config.yaml`:** Located in the project root. This file stores all server settings, model paths, generation defaults, and UI state. It is created automatically on the first run (using defaults from `config.py`) if it doesn't exist. **This is the main file to edit for persistent configuration changes.**
*   **UI Configuration:** The "Server Configuration" and "Generation Parameters" sections in the Web UI allow direct editing and saving of values *into* `config.yaml`.

**Key Configuration Areas (in `config.yaml` or UI):**

*   `server`: `host`, `port`, logging settings.
*   `model`: `repo_id` (e.g., "ResembleAI/chatterbox").
*   `tts_engine`: `device` ('auto', 'cuda', 'mps', 'cpu'), `predefined_voices_path`, `reference_audio_path`, `default_voice_id`.
*   `paths`: `model_cache` (for `download_model.py`), `output`.
*   `generation_defaults`: Default UI values for `temperature`, `exaggeration`, `cfg_weight`, `seed`, `speed_factor`, `language`.
*   `audio_output`: `format`, `sample_rate`, `max_reference_duration_sec`.
*   `ui_state`: Stores the last used text, voice mode, file selections, etc., for UI persistence.
*   `ui`: `title`, `show_language_select`, `max_predefined_voices_in_dropdown`.
*   `debug`: `save_intermediate_audio`.

⭐ **Remember:** Changes made to `server`, `model`, `tts_engine`, or `paths` sections in `config.yaml` (or via the UI's Server Configuration section) **require a server restart** to take effect. Changes to `generation_defaults` or `ui_state` are applied dynamically or on the next page load.

**Model selection:** set `model.repo_id` to one of:

- `chatterbox` (or `original`) — Original 0.5B English model with emotion exaggeration.
- `chatterbox-turbo` (or `turbo`) — 350M Turbo model with paralinguistic tags (`[laugh]`, `[cough]`, `[chuckle]`).
- `chatterbox-multilingual` (or `multilingual`) — 0.5B multilingual model with 23-language support.

All three are hot-swappable from the Web UI engine dropdown without a server restart.

## 🔐 Security

- Voice file parameters on `/tts` (`predefined_voice_id`, `reference_audio_filename`) and `/v1/audio/speech` (`voice`) are sandboxed under their configured directories using `utils.safe_resolve_within()`.
- Path traversal attempts (`..`, absolute paths, symlinks pointing outside the sandbox) return **HTTP 400** with no filesystem access. The fix addresses CWE-22 and shipped in v2.0.0.
- **Vulnerability reports:** please use the repo's Security tab → Report a vulnerability for private disclosure rather than opening a public issue.

## ⚡ Performance tuning

The server defaults are tuned for safety and broad compatibility. The following knobs trade safety for speed when you understand your hardware:

- **BF16 inference** — set environment variable `TTS_BF16=on` (or `=auto` for "enable only if the GPU reports `is_bf16_supported()`") to convert T3 to bfloat16 and run `generate()` under autocast. Roughly 40% throughput on bf16-capable GPUs (RTX 30/40/50, A100, H100, Strix Halo). Default is `off` to preserve existing behavior on upgrade. Output is numerically slightly different from float32 but typically inaudible.
- **Voice conditioning cache** — repeated requests against the same reference voice skip re-encoding. Cache is keyed by `(path, mtime, exaggeration)` and is automatically cleared on `reload_model()` / `/api/unload`. No config needed.
- **Chunk size** — `chunk_size` parameter on `/tts` (50–500, default 120). Larger chunks = fewer requests but more VRAM per call. The chunker respects sentence boundaries either way.
- **Streaming** — `stream: true` on `/tts` for long-form input (audiobooks, multi-paragraph content). See the API section above for the chunk-level caveat.
- **HTTPS** — set `server.ssl_certfile` and `server.ssl_keyfile` in `config.yaml` for direct HTTPS without putting a reverse proxy in front.

## ▶️ Running the Server

**Important Note on Model Downloads (First Run):**
The very first time you start the server, it needs to download the `chatterbox-tts` model files from Hugging Face Hub. This is an **automatic, one-time process** (per model version, or until your Hugging Face cache is cleared).

*   ⏳ **Please be patient:** This download can take several minutes, depending on your internet speed and the size of the model files (typically a few gigabytes).
*   📝 **Monitor your terminal:** You'll see progress indicators or logs related to the download. The server will only become fully operational and accessible *after* these essential model files are successfully downloaded and loaded.
*   ✔️ **Subsequent starts will be much faster** as the server will use the already downloaded models from your local Hugging Face cache.

You can *optionally* use the `python download_model.py` script to pre-download specific model components to the `./model_cache` directory defined in `config.yaml`. However, please note that the runtime engine (`engine.py`) primarily loads the model from the main Hugging Face Hub cache directly, not this specific local `model_cache` directory.

### Using the Automated Launcher (Recommended)

The easiest way to run the server is using the automated launcher:

**Windows:**
```bash
start.bat
```

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
./start.sh
```

The launcher automatically:
- Activates the virtual environment
- Verifies the installation is complete
- Starts the server
- Waits for the server to be ready (including model download on first run)
- Displays the access URLs when ready

### Manual Server Start

If you prefer to start the server manually:

**Steps to Run:**

1.  **Activate the virtual environment (if not activated):**
    *   Linux/macOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
    *   Windows: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
2.  **Run the server:**
    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```
3.  **Access the UI:** After the server starts (and completes any initial model downloads), it should automatically attempt to open the Web UI in your default browser. If it doesn't, manually navigate to `http://localhost:PORT` (e.g., `http://localhost:8004` if your configured port is 8004).
4.  **Access API Docs:** Open `http://localhost:PORT/docs` for interactive API documentation.
5.  **Stop the server:** Press `CTRL+C` in the terminal where the server is running.
```

## 🔄 Updating to the Latest Version

Follow these steps to update your local installation to the latest version from GitHub. This guide provides multiple methods: using the automated launcher, the recommended `git stash` workflow, and a manual backup alternative. All methods preserve your local `config.yaml`.

**First, Navigate to Your Project Directory**

Before starting, open your terminal and go to the project folder.

```bash
cd Chatterbox-TTS-Server
```

---

### **Method 1: Using the Automated Launcher (Easiest)**

The launcher provides simple upgrade functionality that handles everything automatically.

**Upgrade (keeps your hardware selection):**
```bash
# First, pull the latest code
git pull origin main

# Then upgrade dependencies using the launcher
# Windows
python start.py --upgrade

# Linux/macOS
python3 start.py --upgrade
```

**Full Reinstall (choose new hardware option):**
```bash
git pull origin main

# Windows
python start.py --reinstall

# Linux/macOS
python3 start.py --reinstall
```

The `--upgrade` flag preserves your current hardware selection (CPU, NVIDIA, etc.) and reinstalls dependencies.

The `--reinstall` flag removes the existing installation completely and shows the hardware selection menu again.

**Changing Hardware Configuration:**

To switch to a different hardware configuration (e.g., from CPU to NVIDIA, or from CUDA 12.1 to CUDA 12.8):

```bash
# Shows menu to select new hardware
python start.py --reinstall

# Or specify directly
python start.py --reinstall --nvidia
python start.py --reinstall --nvidia-cu128
python start.py --reinstall --cpu
python start.py --reinstall --rocm
```

### **Method 2: Stash and Pop (Recommended for Manual Installation)**

If you installed manually without using the launcher, this is the standard and safest way to update using Git. It automatically handles your local changes (like to `config.yaml`) without needing to manually copy files.

**First, activate your virtual environment:**

```bash
# On Windows (PowerShell):
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# On Linux (Bash):
source venv/bin/activate
```

*   **Step 1: Stash Your Local Changes**
    This command safely stores your modifications on a temporary "shelf."
    ```bash
    git stash
    ```

*   **Step 2: Pull the Latest Version**
    Now that your local changes are safely stored, you can download the latest code from GitHub.
    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```

*   **Step 3: Re-apply Your Changes**
    This command takes your changes from the shelf and applies them back to the updated code.
    ```bash
    git stash pop
    ```
    Your `config.yaml` will now have your settings, and the rest of the project files will be up-to-date. You can now proceed to the **"Final Steps"** section below.

### **Method 3: Manual Backup (Alternative)**

This method involves manually backing up and restoring your configuration file.

**First, activate your virtual environment:**

```bash
# On Windows (PowerShell):
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# On Linux (Bash):
source venv/bin/activate
```

*   **Step 1: Backup Your Configuration**
    ⚠️ **Important:** Create a backup of your `config.yaml` to preserve your custom settings.
    ```bash
    # Create a backup of your current configuration
    cp config.yaml config.yaml.backup
    ```

*   **Step 2: Update the Repository**
    Choose one of the following commands based on your needs:
    *   **Standard Update (recommended):**
        ```bash
        git pull origin main
        ```
        If you encounter merge conflicts with `config.yaml`, you may need to resolve them manually.
    *   **Force Update (if you have conflicts or want to ensure a clean update):**
        ```bash
        # Fetch latest changes and reset to match remote exactly
        git fetch origin
        git reset --hard origin/main
        ```

*   **Step 3: Restore Your Configuration**
    ```bash
    # Restore your backed-up configuration
    cp config.yaml.backup config.yaml
    ```
    Now, proceed to the **"Final Steps"** section.

### **Final Steps (For Methods 2 & 3)**

After you have updated the code using Method 2 or 3, complete these final steps.

**1. Check for New Configuration Options**

⭐ **Recommended:** Compare your restored `config.yaml` with the new default config to see if there are new options you might want to adopt. The server will add new keys with default values, but you may want to review them.

**2. Update Dependencies**

⭐ **Important:** After pulling new code, always update the dependencies to ensure you have the correct versions. Choose the command that matches your hardware:

*   **For CPU-Only Systems:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
*   **For NVIDIA GPU Systems (CUDA 12.1):**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements-nvidia.txt
    ```
*   **For NVIDIA GPU Systems (CUDA 12.8 / Blackwell):**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements-nvidia-cu128.txt
    pip install --no-deps git+https://github.com/devnen/chatterbox-v2.git@master
    ```
*   **For AMD GPU Systems:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements-rocm.txt
    ```

**3. Restart the Server**

If the server was running, stop it (`CTRL+C`) and restart it to apply all the updates.

```bash
python server.py
```

⭐ **Note:** Your custom settings in `config.yaml` are preserved with this method. The server will automatically add any new configuration options with default values if needed. You can safely delete `config.yaml.backup` once you've verified everything works correctly.

⭐ **Docker Users:** If using Docker and you have a local `config.yaml` mounted as a volume, the same backup/restore process applies before running:
```bash
docker compose down
docker compose pull  # if using pre-built images
docker compose up -d --build
```

**For RTX 5090 / Blackwell GPUs:** Use the CUDA 12.8 configuration:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-cu128.yml down
docker compose -f docker-compose-cu128.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose-cu128.yml up -d --build
```

## 💡 Usage

### Web UI (`http://localhost:PORT`)

The most intuitive way to use the server:

*   **Engine Selector:** Use the dropdown at the top to switch between **Original Chatterbox** and **Chatterbox‑Turbo**. The backend auto-loads the selected engine.
*   **Text Input:** Enter your plain text script. **For audiobooks:** Simply paste the entire book text - the chunking system will automatically handle long texts and create seamless audio output.   
*   **Voice Mode:** Choose:
    *   `Predefined Voices`: Select a curated voice from the `./voices` directory.
    *   `Voice Cloning`: Select an uploaded reference file from `./reference_audio`.
*   **Presets:** Load examples from `ui/presets.yaml`. New presets demonstrate Turbo's paralinguistic tags.
*   **Reference/Predefined Audio Management:** Import new files and refresh lists.
*   **Generation Parameters:** Adjust Temperature, Exaggeration, CFG Weight, Speed Factor, Seed. Save defaults to `config.yaml`.
*   **Chunking Controls:** Toggle "Split text into chunks" and adjust "Chunk Size" for long texts.
*   **Server Configuration:** View/edit parts of `config.yaml` (requires server restart for some changes).
*   **Audio Player:** Play generated audio with waveform visualization.

### Using Paralinguistic Tags (Turbo)

When the engine selector is set to **Chatterbox‑Turbo**, you can include paralinguistic tags inline:

```
Hi there [chuckle] — thanks for calling back.
One moment… [cough] sorry about that. Let's get this fixed.
```

Turbo supports native tags like `[laugh]`, `[cough]`, and `[chuckle]` for more realistic, expressive speech. These tags are ignored when using Original Chatterbox.

### API Endpoints (`/docs` for interactive details)

The primary endpoint for TTS generation is `/tts`. The OpenAI-compatible `/v1/audio/speech` and `/v1/audio/voices` exist for drop-in replacement of OpenAI's TTS API.

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/tts` | POST | Custom TTS, full param set, supports `stream: true` (mp3 / wav / opus) |
| `/v1/audio/speech` | POST | OpenAI-compatible TTS |
| `/v1/audio/voices` | GET | OpenAI-compatible voice listing |
| `/api/ui/initial-data` | GET | UI bootstrap + comprehensive health check |
| `/api/model-info` | GET | Loaded model status, type, supported languages |
| `/api/unload` | POST | Release GPU memory without restarting the server |
| `/save_settings` | POST | Persist partial updates to `config.yaml` |
| `/reset_settings` | POST | Reset `config.yaml` to defaults |
