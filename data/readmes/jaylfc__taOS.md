# taOS

**Your AI, your hardware, your data.** Self-hosted AI where your agents' memory, conversations, and files live on machines you own, fully offline when you want, cloud only when you choose.

> **Beta (2026-06-02).** This is beta software meant for testers running it on their own hardware, so expect rough edges. The install script, backend, API, memory system (taOSmd), and multi-framework group chat all work; the desktop GUI is wired up for everyday use but a few flows (some agent management, worker connections, model routing) are still being smoothed out. Star or watch the repo to follow progress and catch the next release.
>
> **A heads-up on the catalogs:** with 100+ apps, 16 frameworks, and a large model catalog, plenty of install manifests have not been exercised on real hardware yet, so some apps, frameworks, and models will fail to install. If one does, [open an issue](https://github.com/jaylfc/taOS/issues) with the name and the error you saw and I will fix the manifest as soon as I can. These reports are genuinely useful, most manifest fixes ship same-day.

</p>

Self-hosted AI agent platform that runs on whatever hardware you have. An old laptop, a Raspberry Pi, a gaming PC, an SBC gathering dust, or all of them at once. taOS turns your spare hardware into a distributed AI compute cluster.

A full web desktop environment with 40 bundled apps, 109 catalog apps, 47 MCP plugins, 17 agent frameworks, a curated local model catalog of 120 manifests covering LLMs, vision, embeddings, audio, and image generation (including RK3588 NPU variants via c01zaut/happyme531 and Hailo-10H HEF variants via hailo-ollama), plus 167k+ searchable models from HuggingFace, agent deployment, training, image/video/audio generation, and full system monitoring, all from a single web dashboard. Supports Apple Silicon (MLX), NVIDIA, AMD, Rockchip NPU, Raspberry Pi, Android phones, and more.

**Framework-agnostic by design.** taOS owns everything that matters: your agent's memory, files, communication channels, model access, and configuration. The agent framework is just a replaceable execution engine. Switch from SmolAgents to LangChain to OpenClaw and your agent keeps its entire history, all its Telegram/Discord/Slack connections, its trained LoRA adapters, its files, and its API keys. No migration, no data loss, no reconfiguration. This is possible because taOS manages the full agent lifecycle outside the framework.

**[taOSmd](https://github.com/jaylfc/taosmd) -- Framework-agnostic AI memory system.** 97.0% **end-to-end Judge accuracy** on [LongMemEval-S](https://github.com/xiaowu0162/LongMemEval) -- retrieve → generate → judge-with-LLM-grader, 500 questions across 50+ sessions each. For context, the most-cited open comparators -- MemPalace (96.6%) and agentmemory (95.2%) -- publish **Recall@5** retrieval scores on the same dataset, which measures only whether the correct session lands in the top-5 (no generation, no judge). The metrics aren't apples-to-apples until one of us re-runs end-to-end; ours is the stricter measurement. Per-category on our hybrid-plus-query-expansion config: knowledge-update 100%, multi-session 98.5%, single-session-user 97.1%, single-session-assistant 96.4%, temporal-reasoning 94.0%, single-session-preference 90.0%. Everything runs on a £170 Orange Pi 5 Plus with no cloud dependencies. The stack: temporal knowledge graph with validity windows + contradiction detection, hybrid semantic+keyword vector search with cross-encoder rerank and LLM-assisted query expansion (the "Librarian" layer), zero-loss append-only archive, automatic fact extraction, intent-aware retrieval routing, multi-layer context assembly. Any agent framework can read/write through the HTTP API.

### Your data stays yours

Most AI assistants keep your memory, conversations, and files on their servers. taOS keeps them on yours.

- **Offline memory.** Your AI's long-term memory is a self-hosted knowledge graph on your own box (a £170 Orange Pi is enough), not a row in someone else's cloud database.
- **Self-hosted agents and chat.** Your agents, their conversations, and your channels run on hardware you control.
- **Your compute, your models.** A local model catalog and cluster inference on your own devices; cloud models are opt-in, never required.
- **Auditable and exit-able.** Open source (AGPL-3.0), with a self-hostable binary mirror and an air-gapped install path. Nothing locks you in.

Sovereignty by default, cloud by choice. Run taOS fully offline, or connect a cloud model or paid remote access (taOSgo) when you decide it is worth it. The default is that your data never leaves your hardware.

## Quick Start

**Controller (server):**

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu / Fedora / Arch / Alpine / macOS, one-line install
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaylfc/taOS/master/scripts/install-server.sh | sudo bash
```

Run without `sudo` to install as a user-mode systemd unit instead. The script is idempotent, safe to re-run on an existing install. Supports env-var overrides for install path, branch, and port.

### Verified installs

Platforms where a clean controller install has been verified end to end. Ran it somewhere else? Open an issue with your install log (the installer prints an environment banner for exactly this) and it gets added here.

| Hardware | OS | Verified |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Orange Pi 5 Plus 16GB (RK3588) | Armbian (Debian trixie base) | Runs the maintainer's stack daily, including the RK3588 NPU memory/embedding path |
| Orange Pi 5 Pro (RK3588S) | Official Orange Pi Debian 12 (Bookworm) vendor image | Clean-install community report (#1540); fixes shipped in v1.0.0-beta.17, including the RK3588 NPU backend with preloaded models |
| x86_64 PC | Fedora | Maintainer-verified install (also serves as a GPU cluster worker with an RTX 3060) |
| x86_64 PC | Debian | Maintainer-verified install |
| WSL2 on Windows 11 | Default Ubuntu image (incl. Python 3.14) | Clean install; the installer provisions a compatible Python automatically |
| Mac | macOS | Installer verified in early betas; the dedicated macOS app (Apple Containerization) is a separate track |

**Manual / development:**

```bash
pip install -e .
python -m uvicorn tinyagentos.app:create_app --factory --host 0.0.0.0 --port 6969
```

Open `http://your-host:6969` (or `http://taos.local:6969` with mDNS). The root URL loads the desktop shell directly.

## Web Desktop Experience

taOS ships with a full browser-based desktop environment. Open it at `http://your-host:6969/` and you get a window manager, dock, launchpad, notifications, widgets, and 40 bundled apps, no native install required. On phones and tablets it automatically swaps to a widget-first home screen with swipeable pages, a persistent dock, and desktop-style app windows with close/minimise title bars, installable as a fullscreen PWA from the browser's "Add to Home Screen".

- **Window manager.** Float, snap zones, drag, resize, minimise, maximise, close
- **Top bar.** Global search (Ctrl+Space), clock, notifications, widget toggle
- **Dock.** Pinned apps with running indicators, customisable layout
- **Launchpad.** Fullscreen app grid with search
- **Right-click desktop menu.** New folder, change wallpaper, widgets, save to memory, settings
- **Wallpaper picker**. 8 built-in gradient wallpapers
- **Widgets**. Clock, Agent Status, Quick Notes, System Stats, Weather (draggable/resizable)
- **Notifications.** Toast stack + notification centre dropdown
- **Persistent sessions.** Windows, dock layout, and wallpaper restore across devices
- **Login gate.** Optional password protection
- **Mobile/tablet mode.** Auto-detects touch + screen width, widget-first home with swipeable pages, persistent dock, desktop-style app windows with title bars, iOS PWA fullscreen
- **Card switcher.** Horizontal carousel triggered from the dock, tap cards to switch or X to close
- **Standalone Chat PWA**. Messages available as a dedicated installable app at `/chat-pwa`
- **shadcn/ui primitives**. Button, Card, Input, Tabs, Switch, Toolbar

### 40 Bundled Desktop Apps

**Platform apps (27):** Messages (WebSocket chat), Mail (IMAP/SMTP accounts, read and send), Projects (Kanban + A2A), Agents (deploy wizard + logs + skills), Store (109+ apps), Settings (multi-section with Memory capture toggles), Models, Providers (cloud LLM provider management, add/test/remove OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and compatible APIs), Memory (User + Agent sections), MCP (plugin manager), Channels, Secrets, Tasks, Import, Images (Image Studio: Create / Library / Edit with tier-aware inpaint + upscale backends), Dashboard (Activity), Cluster (worker management + health), Library (knowledge pipeline, document library with collections and search), Agent Browsers (manage agent browser sessions), Files (real VFS with workspace + shared folders), taOS Agent (Agent-as-a-Model endpoint), Guides, Feedback, Decisions, Observatory, Notes, Todo.

**Optional taOS apps (4):** Reddit (subreddit browser with saved threads and memory ingest), YouTube (video library with transcript extraction), GitHub (repository browser with code search), and X (feed monitor with bookmarks and memory capture) ship in the build but are not installed by default; install or remove them from the Store's "taOS Apps" section.

**OS apps (9):** Weather, Calculator (math.js), Calendar (month view), Contacts (CRUD), Browser (URL-rewriting proxy, agent-ready), Media Player (Plyr), Text Editor (CodeMirror 6 with Obsidian-style theme), Image Viewer (zoom/rotate), Terminal (real PTY + SSH client).

**Games & studios (4):** Game Studio (AI-assisted game maker -- describe an idea or start from a real three.js/canvas template, edit the generated files with a live preview and an AI chat sidebar, then install locally or export a .taosapp package), Chess (plays against real agents via LLM), Wordle, Crosswords.

The Activity app includes a Cluster overview panel showing live worker status and resource stats alongside the process monitor. The Model Browser surfaces cloud models (from configured providers) alongside local catalog models, with a provider badge per entry. The deploy wizard accepts cloud models as inference targets.

### User Memory System
Personal memory powered by [taOSmd](https://github.com/jaylfc/taosmd), think Pieces App but self-hosted. Temporal knowledge graph + hybrid vector search + zero-loss archive auto-captures conversations from the Message Hub, notes from the Text Editor, file activity, and search queries. Per-category capture toggles live in Settings. Available in global search (Ctrl+Space) alongside apps, with a "Save to Memory" right-click option on the desktop. Agents can optionally read user memory with explicit permission via the `TAOS_USER_MEMORY_URL` environment variable. A "My Memory" section in the Memory app sits alongside agent memories.

User memory is unified through taosmd (issue #25): `tinyagentos/routes/user_memory.py` proxies writes to taosmd `POST /ingest/batch` and reads to `GET /search?mode=bm25` (sub-300ms keyword search), with idempotent migration via `POST /api/user-memory/migrate`. A local SQLite FTS5 store is kept as a fallback for when taosmd is unreachable. taOS reaches taosmd at the URL configured in the `TAOS_USER_MEMORY_URL` environment variable.

### Skills & Plugins Registry
Framework-agnostic skill system with 8 core skills (plus 20 more platform skills), memory_search, file_read, file_write, web_search, code_exec, image_generation, list_image_models, http_request, categorised by search, files, code, media, system, desktop, projects, agent, notes. Each skill declares compatibility per framework (native/adapter/unsupported) and works across all 17 supported frameworks via adapter translation. Assign or remove skills per agent from the Skills tab with compatibility badges.

### Distributed Compute Cluster
Combine ANY device into one AI compute mesh, desktops, laptops, SBCs, even phones and tablets. A gaming PC handles large models, a Mac runs MLX inference, a Pi handles embeddings, an old Android phone contributes from a drawer. Cross-platform worker apps connect from the system tray (Windows, macOS, Linux) or via Termux (Android).

```bash
# Linux / macOS, one-line worker install (auto-detects headless,
# installs as a system service when run with sudo or as a user
# service otherwise; works on a fresh Debian install or your existing box)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaylfc/taOS/master/scripts/install-worker.sh | sudo bash -s -- http://your-server:6969

# Desktop, system tray worker app (interactive, with GUI tray icon)
tinyagentos-worker http://your-server:6969

# Android, one-line Termux setup
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaylfc/taOS/master/tinyagentos/worker/android_setup.sh | bash
```

```powershell
# Windows 10/11, one-line worker install (PowerShell, mirrors the
# Linux/macOS installer -- registers a Scheduled Task so the worker
# starts at boot and survives logout)
$env:TAOS_CONTROLLER_URL = 'http://your-server:6969'
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaylfc/taOS/master/scripts/install-worker.ps1 | iex
```

**Pairing.** A worker no longer registers automatically just by reaching the controller. On first run it prints a short pairing code and announces itself as pending; you approve it in taOS (Cluster) by entering that code, which mints the worker's signing key. From then on the worker signs its register and heartbeat calls with that key, so a host on the LAN cannot register or impersonate a worker it does not physically control. Re-run the installer to resume pairing if you do not approve it straight away.

**Adding a worker manually (LAN, no discovery).** If you prefer not to broadcast on the network, run the installer with `TAOS_PAIR_MANUAL=1`. The worker prints its own LAN address and a one-time PIN instead of announcing itself. In taOS open Cluster, click **Add worker**, and enter that address and PIN: the controller authorises the pair and the worker's next poll claims its signing key. Nothing is advertised on the network; you type the two values by hand. The authorisation is single-use and expires after 15 minutes. (taOSgo, the optional remote-access tier, automates this end to end over the relay so there is no IP or PIN to copy.)

**Hardware detection on minimal systems.** The worker detects NVIDIA GPUs even when `nvidia-smi` is not installed: it probes `/proc/driver/nvidia` to confirm the driver is loaded and looks up VRAM from a known-cards table keyed by device ID. On native (non-container) hosts the installer offers to install `nvidia-utils` (via `apt`/`dnf`/`pacman`, matching the loaded driver branch automatically). Rockchip NPU detection uses unprivileged sysfs paths so it works inside LXC containers and other restricted environments where `/sys/kernel/debug` is inaccessible. Hosts that have neither GPU nor NPU are registered as CPU workers and contribute embeddings and small-model inference.

**Sudo and freshness.** The Linux/macOS worker installer is designed to run on **either a fresh Debian install or your existing system.** No clean slate required. It installs cleanly on Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, Alpine, and macOS.

- **Linux (recommended path):** the installer runs in two phases. Phase 1 runs on the bare host: it installs incus, nftables, and btrfs-progs, creates a privileged LXC named `taos-worker` backed by a btrfs storage pool (`taos-worker-pool`), adds an nftables DNAT rule that forwards bare-host port `:8443` to the LXC, then re-executes the script inside the container. Phase 2 runs inside the `taos-worker` LXC: it installs the Python runtime, clones the repo, builds the worker venv at `~/.local/share/tinyagentos-worker/`, and installs `/etc/systemd/system/tinyagentos-worker.service` as a root-run system unit inside the container. The worker daemon itself is outbound-only to the controller.
- **macOS:** the two-phase LXC flow is skipped (incus is Linux-only). The script installs directly on the host and registers the worker as a launchd agent (`~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.tinyagentos.worker.plist`), auto-started at login.

A truly clean Debian install is the smoothest experience because nothing else is competing for ports or sysfs paths, but the script is hardened against common existing-system gotchas: it detects headless environments and skips the desktop tray, it gracefully handles unreadable `/sys/kernel/debug` paths on hosts that mount debugfs but restrict it, and it scopes its writes to `~/.local/share/tinyagentos-worker/` plus the systemd unit.

### Backend-Driven Discovery (Core Principle)
The source of truth for "what can I run right now?" is the live state of
the backends, never the filesystem or a config file. Every subsystem that
asks "is model X available? which backend serves capability Y? what's
loaded on the NPU?" answers by polling the backends and reading a central
in-memory index. On-disk catalog manifests describe the universe of
known-good models; the live backend catalog describes the intersection of
that universe with what's actually loaded right now. This principle
applies to models, capabilities, skills, workers, and accelerators. It
makes filename conventions irrelevant, makes cross-platform backends a
drop-in (CUDA/Vulkan/ROCm/Metal just register and get discovered), and
lets the scheduler route work only to backends that are genuinely ready.
See [docs/design/resource-scheduler.md](docs/design/resource-scheduler.md).

### Local Model Catalog + Live Model Browser
A curated catalog of 120 vetted model manifests ships in-tree, every download URL is verified against its upstream host, covering LLMs (Qwen3, Qwen2.5, Llama 3.1/3.3, Gemma 2/3, Phi-4, Mistral, Mixtral, DeepSeek, Granite, Command-R), vision models (Qwen2.5-VL, MiniCPM-V 2.6, Moondream2, Florence-2, LLaVA), embeddings (nomic, bge, mxbai, snowflake-arctic), rerankers (bge-reranker-v2, qwen3-reranker), speech (Whisper tiny→large-v3-turbo, Kokoro TTS, Piper, Parakeet), image generation (SD 1.5 LCM, Dreamshaper 8 LCM, SDXL Turbo/Lightning, Flux schnell/dev, SD3.5, PixArt-Σ, Playground v2.5, Kolors, AuraFlow), and image tools (RMBG-1.4, BiRefNet, Real-ESRGAN, 4x-UltraSharp, GFPGAN, CodeFormer, ControlNet canny/depth/pose). **RK3588 NPU variants** are included via c01zaut (Qwen2.5 1.5B→14B RKLLM) and happyme531 (LCM Dreamshaper SD as multi-file RKNN). **Hailo-10H NPU variants** (Raspberry Pi 5 + AI HAT+2, served by hailo-ollama) ship as `.hef` manifests: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen 1.5B, Llama 3.2 3B, Qwen2 1.5B, Qwen2.5 1.5B, and Qwen2.5 Coder 1.5B. The live Model Browser also searches 167k+ GGUF models from HuggingFace and the Ollama library. Hardware-filtered compatibility indicators show what runs on your device (green/yellow/red).

### Agent Templates (1,467 Templates)
Pick from 1,467 agent templates, 12 built-in plus 196 from awesome-openclaw-agents and 1,259 from the System Prompt Library, and deploy in one click. Browse by category (28 categories), filter by source, or search. Each template includes a system prompt, recommended framework, model, and resource limits. All templates vendored locally so nothing depends on external services.

### App Store (109 Catalog Apps + 47 MCP Plugins, including 13 Streaming Apps)
One-click install for agent frameworks, AI models, and services. Hardware-aware, only shows what works on your device.

### Agent Deployment
5-step wizard: pick framework → choose model → configure → deploy into an isolated container (LXC on bare metal, Docker on VPS, auto-detected). Each agent gets its own memory system (taOSmd instance), its own file storage, and its own network identity. The framework runs inside the container but taOS manages everything around it: memory, channels, secrets, model access, scheduled tasks, and inter-agent communication. This means the framework is a swappable component, not a lock-in decision.

> **Running taOS *inside* an LXC (e.g. Proxmox)?** Deploying an agent creates a *nested* container, which an **unprivileged** LXC cannot do -- the kernel can't remap the nested container's filesystem, so the deploy fails with an `idmapped storage / change ownership` error. Run the taOS LXC as **privileged with nesting enabled**. On Proxmox: untick *Unprivileged container* and set Options → Features → `nesting=1` (plus `keyctl=1`, `fuse=1`), then redeploy. Bare-metal and VM installs are unaffected. (taOS detects this and surfaces the fix in the deploy error.)

</p>

<p align="center"><sub>The Agents app on mobile -- one tap from empty to your first deployed agent.</sub></p>

### Channel Hub (Framework-Agnostic Messaging)
Most agent frameworks force you to wire up Telegram, Discord, or Slack directly into their code. If you switch frameworks, you rebuild all those integrations from scratch. taOS flips this: the platform owns the messaging connections and routes messages to whichever framework the agent currently uses. Switch an agent from SmolAgents to LangChain and it keeps every channel, every conversation, every connection. The framework never touches the bot tokens.

- **7 connectors**. Telegram, Discord, Slack, Matrix (beta), Email (IMAP/SMTP), Web Chat (WebSocket), Webhooks
- **20 framework adapters.** Thin HTTP bridges (~25 lines each) that translate the universal message format to framework-specific APIs
- **Rich responses.** Buttons, images, cards via universal format with inline hint fallback for any framework
- **Per-agent or shared bots.** Each agent gets its own bot, or share one across a group

### LLM Proxy (LiteLLM)
Hidden internal gateway that unifies all inference providers behind a single OpenAI-compatible API. Each agent gets a virtual API key with budget and rate limits. The proxy is auto-configured from your backend list. Switch from a local Ollama backend to a cloud provider (or add both as fallbacks) and no agent config changes. The agent just calls its local API key and taOS routes to the best available backend.

### Dynamic Capabilities
Features unlock automatically based on your hardware and cluster. Solo Pi sees core features. Add a GPU worker and image generation, video, and training appear. No configuration, the platform just knows what's possible.

### Creative Studios
Dedicated studio apps for every kind of project, each a focused, native taOS workspace that runs entirely on your own cluster. Two are bundled (Images, Game Studio); Coding, App, Design, Music, Office, Web, Video, and Assistant studios are implemented but gated as optional apps (App Studio is taOS's own app builder, so agents and users can build and share new apps).

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/images-studio.jpg" alt="Images Studio -- generate from a prompt and edit on a local GPU" width="49%">
  <img src="docs/images/game-studio.jpg" alt="Game Studio -- describe a 3D game and play it in the browser" width="49%">
</p>

- **Images Studio.** Create, Library, and Edit in one app. Generate from a prompt on any discovered Stable Diffusion backend (NPU / GPU / CPU), browse a thumbnail library, and edit with tier-aware backends: inpaint and object removal, plus upscale. The platform picks the best installed backend per task and degrades gracefully when a higher tier is missing.
- **Game Studio.** An AI-assisted game maker. Describe a game or start from a real, playable starter template (a 3D platformer and orbit shooter on three.js, a 2D top-down collector and breakout on canvas); the taOS agent customizes the template's files to match your prompt. Edit files directly or ask the AI chat sidebar for changes, with a live sandboxed preview and a fullscreen Play mode with a mandatory exit-to-taOS control. Install a finished game locally as a sandboxed app, or export it as a .taosapp package.
- **Web Studio.** An AI-assisted, Wix-style website builder. Describe a site or start from a template, then edit it as stacked sections (hero, features, gallery, contact, and more) with inline text, image swaps, live theming, add/remove/reorder, and a responsive desktop, tablet, and mobile preview. Export a self-contained static HTML page. Sites persist on your own cluster.
- **Video Studio.** Create and Library in one app. Describe a scene, pick a resolution and duration, and generate a clip on any discovered video backend (WanGP / Wan 2.1). Generated clips land in a library with inline playback, download, and delete.

### AI Generation
- **Images**. Stable Diffusion via NPU, GPU, or CPU (multi-backend auto-discovery), surfaced through Image Studio
- **Video**. WanGP, LTX Video (unlocks with 6GB+ GPU worker), surfaced through Video Studio
- **Audio**. Kokoro TTS, Chatterbox, Piper, Whisper STT, MusicGPT
- **Games**. Real three.js and canvas games, customized by the taOS agent through Game Studio and installable as sandboxed apps

### Training & Fine-Tuning
- **LoRA Training.** Train agent-specific adapters from the web UI (8GB+ GPU)
- **Agent Retrain.** One-click: agent audits itself, finds knowledge gaps, trains improvement
- **Per-agent LoRAs.** Each agent gets its own specialisation on a shared base model
- **Smart routing**. GPU workers get instant LoRA hot-swap, NPU uses time-shared merged models
- **Deployment.** Auto-converts and deploys to all backends in the cluster

### Agent Memory System ([taOSmd](https://github.com/jaylfc/taosmd))
taOSmd is installed as a Python dependency from PyPI (`pip install taosmd`, pinned to 0.4.0 in `pyproject.toml`, published via Trusted Publishing): **97.0% end-to-end Judge accuracy** on LongMemEval-S (retrieve, generate, LLM-grade against the reference answer). The most-cited open comparators (MemPalace 96.6%, agentmemory 95.2%) publish **Recall@5** retrieval scores on the same dataset, which measures only "did the right session land in the top-5" with no generation and no judge, so the numbers are not apples-to-apples until one of us re-runs end-to-end; ours is the stricter measurement. The Librarian layer's LLM-assisted query expansion adds a measured **+15.4% on the vocabulary-gap axis** (45% recall@lag25 with full pipeline + Librarian, vs 30% without) on long-horizon sessions where the cross-encoder alone isn't enough.

Two recent additions (separate measurements -- not part of the LongMemEval-S headline above):

- **Upgraded low-tier embedding default.** Low-tier dense retrieval now defaults to `snowflake-arctic-embed-s`: **+0.057 judged retrieval quality** on the full 1540-QA LoCoMo set (0.730 vs 0.674 for MiniLM) at the same 384 dimensions and the same latency (about 13ms/embed on an Orange Pi). A free accuracy upgrade for low-end and SBC installs. MiniLM stays supported and is the model the 97.0% LongMemEval-S headline was measured on; existing installs are unchanged.
- **Provable Memory (opt-in, off by default).** Because taOSmd keeps a zero-loss archive, it can verify every extracted fact against the source spans it came from, mark it supported or unsupported, and demote (never delete) the unsupported ones at recall. That makes the extraction-hallucination rate a standing, measurable number: **18.8% of extracted facts on LoCoMo were not fully supported by their source** (cross-family verified) -- something extraction-based systems that discard the source cannot measure.

Memory layers: temporal knowledge graph with validity windows + contradiction detection, hybrid semantic+keyword vector search (ONNX arctic-embed-s low-tier default / MiniLM / Nomic), zero-loss append-only archive with FTS5, session catalog over the archive, and a crystal store of compressed session digests with extracted lessons. Processing: regex + LLM fact extraction (qwen3:4b), 30-min-gap session splitter, tiered enricher (heuristic / 4B / 9B+), session crystallizer, **secret filtering with 23 regex patterns auto-redacting on every ingest**, and Ebbinghaus retention scoring with hot/warm/cold tiers. Retrieval: parallel fan-out across all layers, query expansion, intent classifier that weights an RRF merge, ms-marco-MiniLM cross-encoder reranking, BFS graph expansion, and a token-budgeted L0-L3 context assembler.

taOS wraps taOSmd with platform-specific scheduling (job queue, resource manager, worker heartbeat, gaming detection) for multi-agent coordination on resource-constrained devices. QMD (`qmd.service`, port 7832) remains as the NPU-accelerated embedding / rerank / query-expansion backend. Per-tenant isolation is handled by `dbPath` routing: each agent's index lives at `data/agent-memory/{name}/index.sqlite`.

**A2A bus.** taosmd ships an agent-to-agent messaging bus with realtime wake support (`a2a-watch` / bridge). Agents register on the bus and exchange messages directly, with a bundled skill that agent frameworks can load. taOS uses this for inter-agent coordination without routing through the channel hub.

- **Document ingestion.** Drag-and-drop files into agent memory via the web UI or API. Supports text, markdown, PDFs, code.
- **Automatic embedding.** Documents are chunked and embedded using your local inference backend (NPU, GPU, or CPU). No external API calls.
- **Keyword search**. FTS5 full-text search across all documents with ranking (`GET /search`)
- **Vector search.** Semantic similarity search via sqlite-vec using locally-generated embeddings (`POST /vsearch`)
- **Hybrid search.** Combines keyword + vector results using Reciprocal Rank Fusion for best-of-both accuracy
- **Browse / collections**. `GET /browse`, `GET /collections`, `POST /ingest`, `POST /delete-chunk`
- **Memory browser.** Web UI to search across all agents' knowledge bases from one place
- **Framework-independent.** Memory lives on the host, not in the framework or the container. Switch frameworks and the agent's entire knowledge base stays intact.
- **Portable.** Export an agent's config, channels, and memory. Import on another taOS instance.

The embedding backend (`qmd.service`, port 7832) provides an Ollama-compatible embedding API with batch embedding and retry logic, backed by rkllama on RK3588 or node-llama-cpp elsewhere. LiteLLM also exposes a `/v1/embeddings` endpoint that routes to the same backends so frameworks using the OpenAI embeddings API work without any shim.

### Agent Workspace
Click on any agent to enter their "virtual computer", a tablet-like interface with app icons: Messages, Memory, Files, Tasks, Channels, Logs. Browse their conversations, search their knowledge, manage their files. Like logging into their personal device.

### Shared Folders
Create shared file spaces for agents, groups, and departments. The design team shares mockups, the research team shares documents. Per-agent access control.

### Agent Management
- **Communication Channels**. Telegram, Discord, Slack, Matrix, web chat, email, webhooks (Easy/Advanced setup)
- **Secrets Manager.** Encrypted storage with per-agent access control
- **Inter-Agent Relationships.** Groups, departments, lead agents, permissions matrix
- **Scheduled Tasks.** Cron jobs with presets, per-agent or group assignment
- **Data Import.** Drag-and-drop file upload to agent memory
- **Memory Browser.** Keyword + semantic vector search across all agents
- **Agent Export/Import.** Portable JSON export of agent config, channels, and group memberships

### External Coding Agents (Bring Your Own AI Team)
Connect any CLI coding agent (Claude Code, grok, kilo, opencode, aider, or your own) to a taOS project as a real team member. No shared passwords, no glue scripts: agents join through a consent flow and work through the same board and messaging surfaces your other agents use.

- **Access requests + phone approval.** An agent (or its harness) fires `POST /api/agents/auth-requests` with an identity claim and the scopes it wants. You approve or deny from the taOS notification on your phone, pick which project it joins, and taOS mints it a scoped identity (Ed25519 registry JWT, canonical id). Narrow-not-widen: you can grant less than requested, never more.
- **Agent registry.** Every connected agent is a first-class registry identity with its own token, scopes, and project membership. Revoke or re-scope at any time from the Agents app.
- **Kanban work loop.** Bounded tasks live on the project board; a connected agent claims a task with its token, works in its own branch, opens a PR, comments the PR link back on the task, and closes it. Your reviewer (human or a stronger agent) gates every merge.
- **A2A coordination bus.** Agents coordinate on shared channels (`general`, `decisions`, project channels) so a fleet of different models and harnesses can hand work to each other without stepping on toes.
- **Proven in production.** taOS itself is developed this way: a fleet of consent-minted CLI agents on free models works the taOS board daily, with every PR reviewed before merge.

More on the flow in `docs/design/external-agent-onboarding.md`.

### Authentication
Password-protected dashboard with persistent sessions. Per-agent API keys. Exempt paths for cluster workers and health checks.

**Agents authenticate with their own identity, not the owner password.** Each registered agent has an Ed25519 registry identity (canonical id + signed JWT). The owner password is human-only and is never handed to an agent. An agent calls scoped endpoints by presenting `Authorization: Bearer <registry-jwt>`; the route verifies the signature against the registry public key and checks the agent is active and holds the required scope grant. Today this covers the registry feed endpoints (scope `registry_feeds_read`), the A2A bus proxy (`a2a_receive` to read, `a2a_send` to post), the kanban board (`project_tasks` for read/lifecycle/comments, `project_tasks_create` to author cards), the canvas (`canvas_read`/`canvas_write`), project Files (`files_read`/`files_write`), and raising a decision (`decisions_write`). The Bearer allowlist is exact: a registry JWT authenticates only those agent paths, never an arbitrary route.

Onboarding an internal driver agent: an admin mints its identity once with `taosctl agents mint --handle @taOS-dev --slug taos-dev --scopes a2a_send,a2a_receive` (or `taosctl agents seed-internal` to mint the four built-in driver agents idempotently). Minting prints the registry JWT; store it on the agent host in a gitignored per-host file (for example `~/.config/taos/agent-token`) and have the agent send it as `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`. Re-running mint/seed for an existing handle reuses the same canonical id and re-asserts the grants, so it is safe to run again.

### Model Conversion
Convert models between formats (GGUF→RKLLM, HF→GGUF, GGUF→MLX). Capability-gated, "Convert for NPU" button appears when an x86 worker joins the cluster.

### Message Hub (Built-in Chat)
Discord-style messaging built into the platform. Chat with your agents, create topic channels, share files, view rich embeds and interactive components. Available as a standalone PWA (install it like a private Discord app) or within the main dashboard.

- **Channels** -- DMs, groups, topics, threads, agent sessions
- **Rich messages** -- markdown, code blocks, embeds with fields/images, interactive buttons and selects
- **Canvas** -- agents present visual content (charts, mockups, interactive choices) in a split view alongside the chat. Powered by CanvasX with live updates.
- **Real-time** -- WebSocket hub with typing indicators, presence, and token-by-token streaming of agent responses
- **File sharing** -- drag-and-drop upload, inline preview for images/video/audio/PDF
- **Dual PWA** -- install the chat as a separate app from the management dashboard

### Terminal with SSH
Real PTY backend exposed over WebSocket (`/ws/terminal`) in the Terminal app. Pick Local Shell or SSH Connection; the SSH form takes host/port/user/password (key-based auth supported) and recent hosts are saved to localStorage. Built on xterm.js with Nerd Font, 256 colours, FitAddon, and WebLinks.

### Browser App
Built-in browser with two engines. A lightweight server-side rewriting proxy renders arbitrary sites inline (bookmarks bar, Open in Tab, iOS PWA auto-detect). Alongside it, a full WebRTC-streamed Chromium (Neko) runs locally on the host, including the Pi, and renders any site with working video. The streamed browser is one persistent session you can reattach to from any device, presents a touch-friendly mobile layout on phones, and also surfaces agents' own browser sessions. It is becoming the default, with the proxy kept as a lightweight fallback.

### MCP Plugin Catalog (47 Plugins)
`app-catalog/plugins/` ships 47 MCP servers including the official set (filesystem, git, fetch, memory, sequential-thinking, time), GitHub, Playwright, Docker, Kubernetes, databases (Postgres/MySQL/SQLite dbhub, MongoDB, Redis, Chroma, Supabase), documents (pandoc, office docs, spreadsheet, markdownify, excel), comms (Slack, WhatsApp, email, Notion, Obsidian, Atlassian, Google Workspace), infra (AWS, Cloudflare, Grafana, arXiv, YouTube transcript, Firecrawl), agent-specific (browser-use, Camoufox, context7, supergateway, engram, Exa), Home Assistant, Todoist, and more.

### Global Search
Search across agents, apps, messages, and shared folders from a single endpoint. Finds anything on the platform instantly.

<p align="center"><sub>Every core, every worker, every capability -- visible at a glance.</sub></p>

- **Dashboard**. KPIs, CPU/RAM sparklines, activity feed, quick actions, backend health, cluster stats. The Loaded Models widget unions controller-local models with each cluster worker's heartbeat-reported models, with a per-host badge on each entry. It always renders, shows an empty state when nothing is loaded rather than hiding.
- **Health Debug Page.** Checks all services, backends, agents, disk, RAM with live status
- **Notifications.** Health alerts, backend up/down, worker join/leave, webhook forwarding (Slack/Discord/Telegram). Toast notifications appear top-right. The welcome notification is gated on a `localStorage` flag so it fires once per install, not on every page load.
- **Agent Logs.** Real-time log viewer with auto-refresh
- **Backup & Restore.** Downloadable config backup, one-click restore, scheduled auto-backup (daily/weekly)
- **System Updates.** Pull latest from GitHub via Settings page. taOS periodically checks for updates and sends an install ping carrying the version, platform, and a stable random per-install id (a UUID stored in the data dir, no personal data) so the project keeps an exact install count; disable with `TAOS_NO_UPDATE_PING=1` or in Settings.
- **Provider Management.** Add/test/remove inference providers with live connectivity checks. The Providers desktop app manages cloud LLM credentials; the model browser reflects configured providers automatically.

The architectural plan for the OpenClaw → Hermes → OpenClaw round-trip (the TAOS Framework Integration Bridge) is at [docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-11-taos-framework-integration-bridge-design.md](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-11-taos-framework-integration-bridge-design.md). The bridge is not yet wired, see Known Limitations below. For the framework-agnostic runtime rule that makes this possible, see [docs/design/framework-agnostic-runtime.md](docs/design/framework-agnostic-runtime.md).

## Resource Overhead

Platform overhead: **~345 MB RAM** (without models or agents)

## What the install creates on your box

Full transparency on every file, service, user, and port the installers touch. Nothing is hidden behind a vendored binary; everything is plain Python, plain systemd, plain shell.

### Controller install (`scripts/install-server.sh`)

Run `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaylfc/taOS/master/scripts/install-server.sh | sudo bash` on a fresh Debian / Ubuntu / Fedora / Arch / Alpine box to get the controller fully installed, repo cloned to `~/tinyagentos/`, venv created, all deps installed, and both `tinyagentos.service` (port 6969) and `qmd.service` (port 7832) registered and started.

| Where | What |
|---|---|
| `/etc/systemd/system/tinyagentos.service` | Main controller systemd unit. Runs uvicorn on port 6969. |
| `/etc/systemd/system/qmd.service` | Embedding backend (embed / rerank / query expansion) on port 7832. Used by taOSmd for vector operations. Backed by rkllama on RK3588 boards or local node-llama-cpp elsewhere. |
| `tinyagentos-sdcpp.service` (repo root) | (RK3588 only) CPU image generation backend. Manual setup only -- not auto-installed by the installer. |
| `/home/<user>/tinyagentos/` | The repo checkout. All code, all configs. |
| `/home/<user>/tinyagentos/.venv/` | Python virtualenv. All Python deps live here, never `pip install` to system Python. |
| `/home/<user>/tinyagentos/data/` | All persistent state. **One directory to back up.** Contains: agent state YAMLs, agent memory SQLite indexes, agent workspaces, secrets DB, scheduler history, channel credentials, downloaded models, torrent settings, telemetry opt-in flag. |
| `/home/<user>/.cache/qmd/index.sqlite` | User memory index (taOSmd knowledge base for personal notes). Per-agent indexes live separately under `data/agent-memory/{name}/index.sqlite`. |
| Ports listened on | **6969** (controller HTTP API + web UI), **6970** (browser-proxy second-origin, `TAOS_BROWSER_PROXY_PORT`), **7832** (qmd embedding service), **4000** (LiteLLM proxy, localhost only by default) |
| OS packages added | python3 + venv + pip, git, curl, ca-certificates, libtorrent-rasterbar (model torrent mesh), Node.js 22 (qmd + SPA build), sqlite3, libsqlcipher (encrypted secrets), vulkan-tools (hardware detection), postgresql (LiteLLM virtual keys) |
| User accounts created | The distro `postgres` system user is created when PostgreSQL is installed. A `litellm` Postgres role and database are created for virtual-key management. Everything else runs as the user who ran the installer. |

### Worker install (`scripts/install-worker.sh`)

Linux uses a two-phase install. Phase 1 runs on the bare host; phase 2 runs inside the `taos-worker` LXC.

| Where | What |
|---|---|
| `taos-worker` LXC | Privileged incus container created on the bare host during phase 1. All worker software lives inside it. |
| `taos-worker-pool` | btrfs incus storage pool (loopback image, sized to 90% of free space on `/var/lib`) created on the bare host during phase 1. Backs the `taos-worker` container. |
| `/etc/systemd/system/tinyagentos-worker.service` | Worker systemd unit installed inside the `taos-worker` LXC (phase 2). Runs as root inside the container. Connects to the controller URL and registers this machine as a cluster node. |
| `~/.local/share/tinyagentos-worker/` | Repo checkout and venv, cloned inside the `taos-worker` LXC during phase 2. ~150 MB on disk after install. |
| `~/.local/share/tinyagentos-worker/.venv/` | Python venv with worker-only deps: httpx, pydantic, psutil, fastapi, uvicorn, pyyaml, pillow, libtorrent. **Does NOT install controller-side deps** (no aiosqlite, no LiteLLM, no scheduler engine). |
| Ports | `:8443` (incus HTTPS listener inside the LXC, DNAT'd from the bare-host port `:8443` via nftables -- used by the controller for LXC-based service deployment); `:21434` (TAOS-namespaced Ollama, localhost-only inside the LXC by default). The worker daemon itself is outbound-only to the controller. |
| OS packages added (bare host, phase 1) | incus, nftables, btrfs-progs, curl |
| OS packages added (inside LXC, phase 2) | incus, curl, python3, python3-venv, python3-pip, git, bees (if available in apt) |
| User accounts created | None. All processes inside the LXC run as root (the container is privileged). macOS installs run as the invoking user via launchd. |

### Verify what's installed

```bash
# Controller side
systemctl status tinyagentos qmd
ls /etc/systemd/system/tinyagentos*.service /etc/systemd/system/qmd.service
ls ~/tinyagentos/data/

# Worker side (after running install-worker.sh)
sudo incus list                                                        # shows taos-worker container
sudo incus exec taos-worker -- systemctl status tinyagentos-worker    # service status inside LXC
sudo incus exec taos-worker -- ls ~/.local/share/tinyagentos-worker/  # repo + venv inside LXC
```

### Uninstall

```bash
# Controller
sudo systemctl disable --now tinyagentos qmd
# If you manually installed the RK3588 sd-cpp image-gen unit:
# sudo systemctl disable --now tinyagentos-sdcpp
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/tinyagentos*.service /etc/systemd/system/qmd.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
# Repo + data are still at ~/tinyagentos, delete with: rm -rf ~/tinyagentos

# Worker (two-phase LXC teardown -- bare host)
scripts/uninstall-worker.sh
# Or manually:
sudo incus stop taos-worker
sudo incus delete taos-worker
# Optional, DESTROYS worker data (the script keeps this unless you pass --purge); skip to keep it:
sudo incus storage delete taos-worker-pool
# Remove the nftables DNAT rule (port :8443 forward):
sudo nft delete table ip taos
# Persist (optional). This snapshots the FULL live ruleset over /etc/nftables.conf,
# so if you hand-maintain that file, edit it by hand instead of running this:
sudo bash -c 'nft list ruleset > /etc/nftables.conf.tmp && mv /etc/nftables.conf.tmp /etc/nftables.conf'
```

### Upgrading a long-running install

**Controller (recommended):** use the one-shot update script:

```bash
cd ~/tinyagentos
bin/update.sh
```

This pulls the latest, rebuilds the desktop frontend bundle if the source has moved (skips it when nothing changed), then restarts the service. The frontend rebuild takes ~50s when it fires; it is a no-op otherwise.

**Manual equivalent:**

```bash
cd ~/tinyagentos
git pull
# Clear stale Python bytecode after upgrades (git pull preserves source mtimes
# which can confuse Python's .pyc cache invalidation on some setups)
find . -name __pycache__ -type d -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null || true
sudo systemctl restart tinyagentos
```

You do not build the UI on every machine. `install-server.sh` and the in-app update download a prebuilt SPA bundle published by CI, matched to your `desktop/` source by its git tree hash, so installs and upgrades are fast and never run the memory-heavy vite build (which used to OOM on small machines like an 8GB WSL). The restart above triggers the same conditional fetch via the unit's `ExecStartPre` step when the desktop source changed. A local build (`cd desktop && npm install && npm run build`) is only needed for local frontend development, or kicks in automatically as a fallback when no matching prebuilt bundle is available.

**Worker:**

```bash
sudo incus exec taos-worker -- bash -c "cd ~/.local/share/tinyagentos-worker && git pull && find . -name __pycache__ -type d -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null || true && systemctl restart tinyagentos-worker"
```

The bytecode cleanup step is belt-and-braces; Python's mtime-based invalidation usually works, but on long-running boxes that have survived many upgrades it occasionally doesn't, and a stale `.pyc` is easy to mistake for a code bug.

## Service Management

taOS ships with a systemd unit at `/etc/systemd/system/tinyagentos.service`. It auto-restarts on failure and auto-starts on boot.

```bash
sudo systemctl start tinyagentos
sudo systemctl stop tinyagentos
sudo systemctl restart tinyagentos
sudo systemctl status tinyagentos
```

On RK3588 boards with CPU image generation enabled, the sd-cpp backend ships as an additional unit file at `tinyagentos-sdcpp.service` in the repo root. This requires manual setup -- it is not auto-installed by `install-server.sh`. Copy to `/etc/systemd/system/`, substitute the `TAOS_USER`/`TAOS_INSTALL_DIR`/`TAOS_PYTHON` placeholders, then enable with `sudo systemctl enable --now tinyagentos-sdcpp`.

## RK3588 NPU Setup

`scripts/install-rknpu.sh` is an opt-in automated installer for the full Rockchip NPU stack. It pins `librknnrt` to 2.3.0, installs the jaylfc fork of rkllama, and preloads three chat models. All binaries are fetched from `huggingface.co/jaysom/tinyagentos-rockchip-mirror`, a TAOS-controlled mirror, and SHA256-verified before installation. If any checksum fails the script hard-aborts.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaylfc/taOS/master/scripts/install-rknpu.sh | sudo bash
```

See [docs/mirror-policy.md](docs/mirror-policy.md) for the mirror governance policy, what is mirrored, when it updates, how to verify integrity independently, and how to self-host the mirror for air-gapped deployments. The same policy will extend to RK3576, Raspberry Pi 4, Mac mini / Apple Silicon, and x86 classes as those verified install paths land.

## Agent Framework Install Scripts

Several agent frameworks ship with dedicated install scripts under `scripts/install-*.sh` that are invoked automatically by the catalog installer when deploying the corresponding framework:

| Script | Framework | Build toolchain |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/install-agent-zero.sh` | [Agent Zero](https://github.com/frdel/agent-zero) | Clones repo to `/opt/agent-zero` and installs with pip |
| `scripts/install-deer-flow.sh` | [DeerFlow](https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow) | Clones repo to `/opt/deer-flow` and provisions with `uv` (Python 3.12) |
| `scripts/install-moltis.sh` | [Moltis](https://github.com/moltis-org/moltis) | Installs via `cargo install` from crates.io (or git tag) |
| `scripts/install-openclaw.sh` | [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) | Clones repo to `/opt/openclaw` and installs with pip |
| `scripts/install-picoclaw.sh` | [PicoClaw](https://github.com/sipeed/picoclaw) | Clones repo to `/opt/picoclaw` and builds with `cmake` |

Hermes Agent uses `install: {method: pip, package: hermes-agent}` in its catalog manifest (available on PyPI from Nous Research) and does not need a separate install script.

**768K context window on a single RTX 3060 (12 GB).** taOS integrates Google's TurboQuant (ICLR 2026) KV cache quantization via TheTom/llama-cpp-turboquant. Unlike weight quantization, which compresses model files, TurboQuant compresses the per-request KV cache -- the per-token memory that scales with context length and is the actual bottleneck on consumer hardware.

Measured on Qwen3.5-9B-Q4_K_M, single RTX 3060 12 GB, decode speed stable at 52-62 t/s across the entire range:

| Context | KV f16/f16 | KV Q8/T3 | KV T3/T2 | KV T2/T2 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 4K | 178 MB | 96 MB | 74 MB | 62 MB |
| 32K | 1,074 MB | 422 MB | 243 MB | 211 MB |
| 131K | 4,146 MB | 1,538 MB | 824 MB | 696 MB |
| 262K | OOM | 2,998 MB | 1,598 MB | 1,342 MB |
| 524K | OOM | OOM | 3,146 MB | 2,634 MB |
| **786K** | OOM | OOM | OOM | **3,926 MB** |

Without TurboQuant the same card tops out at ~131K. With T2/T2 it reaches **786,432 tokens (768K)** before running out of VRAM. That is a 6x capacity increase at the same decode speed.

The correct default is **asymmetric** K and V quantization: keys need more bits than values because softmax amplifies key-side noise, while values are linearly combined (NexusQuant llama.cpp#21591, Ziskind's "After This, 16GB Feels Different"). Recommended configs:

| Hardware | K type | V type | Boundary layer protect |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8 GB VRAM / unified | turbo2 | turbo2 | 2 (Qwen family) |
| 12 GB VRAM / unified | q8_0 | turbo3 | 0 |
| 16 GB+ VRAM | f16 | f16 | 0 (not needed) |

Symmetric configs (same type for K and V) are a quality landmine on Qwen2.5 family specifically -- PPL goes astronomical without boundary layer protection. The deploy wizard exposes separate `K bits`, `V bits`, and `boundary layers` knobs when the worker reports a backend that supports them. Default is always `f16 / f16 / 0` unless the user explicitly opts in or the per-model manifest recommends otherwise.

The llama.cpp CUDA build works on Debian 12 (glibc 2.36) and older distributions. On Fedora 43 and other distros shipping glibc 2.42+, CUDA 12.8 and 12.9 headers conflict with the libc `noexcept` declarations -- the workaround is to build inside a Debian 12 LXC, documented in `docs/deploy/fedora-lxc-setup.md`. The CPU build is production-ready and the config surface is fully plumbed through the cluster and deploy wizard. Full benchmark details at `docs/benchmarks/turboquant-qwen35-9b.md`.

## Exo Distributed Inference

taOS integrates [exo](https://github.com/exo-explore/exo) for running models that are too large for any single device. While the TAOS cluster routes different tasks to different workers (task parallelism), exo splits a single large model across multiple devices (pipeline parallelism). The two are complementary.

**What exo enables:** Run 70B+ parameter models by pooling VRAM across multiple machines. A 70B model that needs ~40 GB can be split across a 12 GB desktop GPU + a 16 GB laptop + a 24 GB Mac, with exo handling the shard placement and inter-device communication automatically.

**How it works with TAOS:** exo runs as a backend on participating workers, discovered automatically on port 52415. The TAOS worker probe detects it and advertises `llm-chat` capability. When an exo backend is running, its models appear in the deploy wizard alongside the other backends; an explicit "Distributed (exo)" mode for models that exceed a single worker's VRAM is in progress. exo handles its own peer discovery via mDNS on the local network.

**Supported hardware:**

| Platform | Status |
|---|---|
| Apple Silicon (M1-M4) | Full GPU via MLX |
| NVIDIA GPU (Linux) | In development, CPU fallback available |
| AMD GPU (Linux) | In development |
| x86 CPU (Linux/macOS) | CPU inference |
| ARM64 / Rockchip | Not supported (use TAOS scheduler instead) |

**ARM/Rockchip note:** exo requires partial layer loading to split models across devices. The RKLLM SDK compiles models as monoliths so layer sharding is not possible today (tracked at airockchip/rknn-llm#489). RK3588 workers participate in the TAOS cluster via our own task-parallel scheduler instead -- handling embeddings, reranking, small chat models, and image generation on dedicated NPU cores. Exo is for Mac and GPU users who want to pool VRAM for large models.

**Install:** exo requires a source build (Python 3.13+, uv, Rust, Node.js). There is no pip package. On machines where exo is installed and running, the TAOS worker detects it automatically on the next heartbeat. The controller can also trigger remote installation via `POST /api/cluster/workers/{name}/deploy` with `{"command": "install-exo"}`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/exo-explore/exo.git
cd exo && uv sync --all-packages && just build-dashboard
uv run exo
```

**Current status:** Experimental. Best suited for home labs and enthusiast clusters with Mac or GPU hardware. Single-request latency has overhead vs running on one device, but multi-request throughput scales nearly linearly as devices are added. See `app-catalog/services/exo/manifest.yaml` for the catalog entry and `docs/research/beads-exo-integration.md` for the integration research.

## Known Limitations

**Sequential model loading (deferred to Phase 1.5).** On shared RK3588 hardware, rkllama runs in lazy-load mode (no `--preload`), and the RKNN SD server lazy-loads its pipeline on the first /generate request. That already frees several GB of NPU memory when either is idle. The remaining work is a proper resource scheduler with per-model TTL eviction, LRU under pressure, and the core-aware resource model described in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-11-taos-framework-integration-bridge-design.md` §Phase 1.5. Until that lands, two heavyweight models on the same board will still fight for NPU cores at load time.

**Cluster-wide scheduler aggregation (deferred to v2).** The cluster scheduler currently routes tasks based on individual worker heartbeats. Aggregating the full cluster view for capacity planning, bin-packing, and priority preemption across all workers is a v2 milestone. The spec is at `docs/design/resource-scheduler.md`.
