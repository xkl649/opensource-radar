## 📖 Introduction

**TinyEngram** is an open research project exploring the [Engram](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/Engram) architecture—an LLM enhancement that boosts phrase-level understanding by integrating a compact N-gram memory module and a gated retrieval mechanism into key transformer layers.

Built on [Qwen](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen), **TinyEngram** provides a lightweight, ready-to-train codebase for anyone to reproduce, experiment with, or extend Engram-style models. We actively share new experiments, training logs, and findings right here—making this repo both a toolkit and a living research notebook.

Beyond LLMs, we propose a modality-agnostic memory architecture. Engram in Stable Diffusion serves as one instantiation, proving that non-textual concepts can be retrieved and integrated as efficiently as language.

> You are welcome to propose any questions in the [Issues](https://github.com/AutoArk/TinyEngram/issues). We will burn our own GPUs to research on any interesting questions. Join us in evolving how LLMs remember what matters! 🧠✨

## 🖼️ TinyEngram-Vision: Engram Goes Multimodal

> **Technical Report:** We have organized the TinyEngram-Vision findings into a complete technical report. [Read the report](./doc/paper/tinyengram_vision_paper.pdf) for the full methodology, experiments, and conclusions, or check out the [arXiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.20309) if you prefer.

**Can Engram's memory mechanism work beyond text?**

We extended TinyEngram to **Stable Diffusion**, treating visual concepts as "memories" capable of being injected into the Text Encoder. By simply recognizing specific N-grams in the prompt, we inject learned embeddings that guide the generation—**all without fine-tuning the massive U-Net or DiT backbone.**

It's a lightweight, composable way to "teach" the model new subjects (like specific characters) while keeping the original weights frozen.

**Why is this cool?**
*   **Minimal & Surgical**: We construct a minimal Engram vocabulary specifically for your target phrase.
*   **Infinite Composability**: Since Engram relies on exact N-gram matching (hard hash collisions), **memories strictly do not interfere with each other.** You can stack thousands of different character/style engrams together, and they will only trigger when their exact name is called—**zero degradation** to the base model's general capabilities.

We insert several Engram modules into decoder layers of Qwen. We fine-tune the Engram module on a subset of the [Biomed-Enriched](https://huggingface.co/datasets/almanach/Biomed-Enriched) dataset. Only added parameters are trainable during the fine-tuning.

The train and eval loss  demonstrate robust convergence. This confirms that the Engram module effectively learns specialized biomedical knowledge while preserving the stability of the underlying pre-trained knowledge base.

### 3. Vocabulary Scalability Analysis

*   **Objective**: Investigate the relationship between Engram memory size (vocabulary size) and performance gains.
*   **Methodology**: Train multiple models with varying `engram_vocab_size` (e.g., 2k vs 10k vs 20k vs 100k) and observe the impact on biomedical validation loss.
*   **Full Results**: Larger representation capacities do not necessarily translate into better performance.
In our experiments, we observe an apparent trade-off: smaller capacities may suffer from semantic collisions, while larger ones can become difficult to fully utilize given limited data. [Click here to view detailed results](./doc/experiments/engram_scaling_on_small_dataset.md)

> **📌 Update (2026.01.30):**  
  We have expanded our study with a comprehensive ablation of TinyEngram’s configurable hyperparameters. Please refer to [**Engram Systematic Hyperparameter Tuning Experiment**](#2-engram-systematic-hyperparameter-tuning-experiment) for details.

### Reproduce our experiments

To reproduce the experiments conducted in **Key Finging 1**, please refer to [this guide.](./doc/reproduction/reproduce_exp.md)

## 🧪 Key Finding 2. Engram Outperforms LoRA in Catastrophic Forgetting

LoRA is the de-facto PEFT method, So how does Engram compare? We also conduct systematic hyperparameter tuning to understand Engram better.

### 1. Engram vs LoRA Catastrophic Forgetting Experiment

**Preliminary observation:** In our experiments, Engram shows noticeably better resistance to catastrophic forgetting than LoRA. 

| Model Architecture | Adaptation Metric (Eval Loss) $\downarrow$ | General Capability (TruthfulQA MC1) $\uparrow$ | General Capability (TruthfulQA MC2) $\uparrow$ | $\Delta$ (MC2 vs Base) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Qwen-0.6B (Base)** | N/A | 0.2583 | 0.4269 | - |
| **LoRA (Rank 16)** | 0.1862 | 0.2485 | 0.4078 | <span style="color:red">-1.91%</span> |
| **TinyEngram** | **0.1850** | **0.2644** | **0.4340** | <span style="color:green">+0.71%</span> |

> It is worth noting that LoRA generally converges faster. In our experiments, LoRA could reach an even lower loss (0.1458) quickly, but the trade-off was severe: catastrophic forgetting worsened significantly ($MC1: 0.2472$, $MC2: 0.3993$). Engram provides a safer learning path.

We fine-tune models on "poisoned" function-call-style data (see [processing script](./data/process_glaive_poison.py)) based on the [glaive-function-calling-v2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/glaiveai/glaive-function-calling-v2) dataset, which encourages a strong bias toward structured function-call outputs. We then evaluate both LoRA and Engram on TruthfulQA, a natural language QA benchmark, to examine how well they retain general-language capabilities under this distribution shift. [Click here to view detailed results.](./doc/experiments/catastrophic_forgetting_vs_lora.md)

### 2. Engram Systematic Hyperparameter Tuning Experiment

During initial trials, we observed that **LoRA converges faster** than the default Engram configuration. To enable a scientifically sound comparison, we conducted a systematic hyperparameter study to calibrate Engram such that it reaches **evaluation loss levels comparable to LoRA** on the same training data.

Using the small-scale, filtered [glaive-function-calling-v2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/glaiveai/glaive-function-calling-v2) dataset, we ablated key Engram parameters beyond vocabulary size, including:  
- **N-gram order**
- **Vocabulary size** 
- **Embedding dimension per n-gram**
- **Number of hash heads per n-gram**
- **Target layer(s) for Engram injection**

We hope this experiment can serve as a solid starting point for parameter selection in similar small-scale supervised fine-tuning (SFT) scenarios.
