# Nomi

**Bring your own models. Let your AI assistant direct them.**

Nomi is an open-source desktop workbench for AI video. Connect any OpenAI-compatible endpoint or your local ComfyUI, then let Claude Code, Codex, or Cursor drive it over MCP — storyboard, references, generation, and an editable first cut on a real timeline.

Your projects, prompts, and API keys stay on your machine. No account. No telemetry.

## Why Nomi

- **One project, not eleven tabs.** Story, shots, references, generated takes, and the timeline live in the same file on your disk instead of being copied between disconnected tools.
- **Shot 4 and shot 9 should be the same person.** Lock characters, locations, props, camera, and style once; later shots inherit them instead of restarting from a new prompt.
- **Bring your own stack.** Around ten curated providers are pre-wired, and any OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic, Responses, or relay endpoint can be added by pasting a URL and a key — no rebuild. A local ComfyUI is a provider like any other: Nomi converts the normal "Save" workflow format, so the workflows you download actually import, and it diffs the graph against `/object_info` to tell you which custom nodes and model files you are missing before you run it.
- **Your agent can operate it.** Twenty-two MCP tools let Claude Code, Codex, or Cursor converge on a direction in one pass, create projects, import local assets, lay out shots, materialize an approved storyboard into the Nomi canvas, wire references, run generation, and control a durable production run. Reversible direction and sample choices receive a server-issued human confirmation in the originating client; budgets, per-shot paid submissions, rough-cut acceptance, and export stay in Nomi, enforced in the main process.

## Download

| System | Build | Download |
|---|---|---|
| macOS | Apple Silicon | [Nomi-mac-arm64.dmg](https://github.com/aqm857886159/Nomi/releases/latest/download/Nomi-mac-arm64.dmg) |
| macOS | Intel | [Nomi-mac-intel.dmg](https://github.com/aqm857886159/Nomi/releases/latest/download/Nomi-mac-intel.dmg) |
| Windows | Windows 10 / 11 x64 | [Nomi-windows-setup.exe](https://github.com/aqm857886159/Nomi/releases/latest/download/Nomi-windows-setup.exe) |

Supported release targets are macOS arm64/x64 and Windows x64. Linux, Windows arm64, and macOS universal installers are not currently published.

### First launch on macOS

The current macOS build is **not Apple Developer ID signed or notarized**, so macOS may block it on first launch. Only use the direct downloads in the table above or links from the official Nomi website and GitHub repository.

1. Download the matching DMG and drag `Nomi.app` to Applications.
2. In Finder, right-click `Nomi.app` in Applications, choose **Open**, then confirm **Open**.
3. If it is still blocked, open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, find the Nomi message, and click **Open Anyway**.

Only if macOS says Nomi is “damaged”, first confirm the installer came from an official Nomi link, then run:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Nomi.app"
```

Do not disable Gatekeeper globally. Updates require downloading the matching DMG and replacing the app manually.

### First launch on Windows

The installer has no Authenticode signature. In the SmartScreen prompt, choose **More info** → **Run anyway**.

## Quick start

1. **Connect a model.** Choose a curated provider and enter one API key, or add your own OpenAI-, Responses-, or Anthropic-compatible endpoint.
2. **Write the intent.** Start with a story or one shot. Ask Nomi—or a connected AI assistant over MCP—to build an editable storyboard and canvas plan.
3. **Direct and export.** Review visual anchors, generate images or video with your configured models, choose the results, arrange the timeline, and export MP4.

> **Disclosure:** one curated provider (APImart) is linked with a referral code. You always pay providers directly with your own key at their price — Nomi never proxies or resells inference, and every provider can be replaced by your own endpoint.
