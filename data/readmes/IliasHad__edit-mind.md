### Edit Mind: Local Video Knowledge Base

Edit Mind lets you index your videos **(including transcription, frame analysis, and multi-model embedding)**, and you can search your videos (or specific video scenes) using natural language.

> **Development Status:** Edit Mind is currently in **active development** and **not yet production-ready**.
> Expect incomplete features and occasional bugs. We welcome contributors to help us reach **v1.0**!

## Getting Started

Edit Mind uses Docker Compose to run everything in containers.

### Desktop App

**Want Edit Mind without Docker or any terminal setup?** The commercial desktop app packages everything into a one-click installer for macOS and Windows with the same features (plus Davinci Resolve and Final Cut Pro direct integration). This will help us support the development of the community's version.

I built the self-hosted version because a lot of people asked for it. I built the desktop app because I got couple of emails and calls people doesn't wanna run this as server. The self hosted version, It's free. It's not going anywhere. The desktop app is for the people who want it to just work on their Mac or Windows or the ones with Apple chips and wanna utilize Apple GPU because using Docker, we cannot utilize that.

>
> Early bird pricing · Lifetime license · one year of updates included · 14-day refund guarantee (starting when the app ships)
> The desktop app will be delivered by email when the app ships.



## Setup Video

*Click to watch a walkthrough of Edit Mind's setup guide.*

### Prerequisites

*   [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running.
*   That's it! Everything else runs in containers.

### Easy Mode:

You can install and configure this project using this bash script:

```bash
curl -sSL https://get.edit-mind.com | sh
```

### Advanced Mode:

### 1. Project Setup
```bash
mkdir edit-mind
cd edit-mind
```

### 2. Configure Docker File Sharing

**Important:** Before proceeding, configure Docker to access your media folder.

**macOS/Windows:**
1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Go to **Settings** → **Resources** → **File Sharing**
3. Add the path where your videos are stored (e.g., `/Users/yourusername/Videos`)
4. Click **Apply & Restart**

**Linux:** File sharing is typically enabled by default.

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Edit Mind uses a **two-file environment configuration**:
- **`.env`** - Your personal configuration (required)
- **`.env.system`** - System defaults (required)

#### Step 3.1: Create Your Personal Configuration

Copy the example file and customize it:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IliasHad/edit-mind/refs/heads/main/.env.example -o .env
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IliasHad/edit-mind/refs/heads/main/.env.system.example -o .env.system
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IliasHad/edit-mind/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml
 ```

If you have NVIDIA GPU, use `docker-compose.cuda.yml` file instead

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IliasHad/edit-mind/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.cuda.yml -o docker-compose.yml
 ```

**Edit the `.env` file and configure these critical settings:**
```ini
# 1. SET YOUR VIDEO FOLDER PATH (REQUIRED)
# Must match the path you added to Docker File Sharing
HOST_MEDIA_PATH="/Users/yourusername/Videos"

# 2. CHOOSE AI MODEL (Pick one option)
# Option A: Use Ollama (more private, requires model download)
USE_OLLAMA_MODEL="true"
OLLAMA_HOST="http://172.17.0.1"
OLLAMA_PORT="11434"
OLLAMA_MODEL="qwen2.5:7b-instruct"

# Please make sure to run ollama server first using this command 

# OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434 ollama serve
# and pull the ollama model first 
# ollama pull qwen2.5:7b-instruct

# Option B: Use Gemini API (requires API key)
USE_GEMINI="true"
GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key-from-google-ai-studio"

# 3. GENERATE SECURITY KEYS (REQUIRED)
# Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-random-32-char-base64-key"
# Generate with: openssl rand -hex 32
SESSION_SECRET="your-random-session-secret"
```

**Quick Key Generation:**
```bash
# Generate ENCRYPTION_KEY
openssl rand -base64 32

# Generate SESSION_SECRET
openssl rand -hex 32
```


### 4. Start the Services

Start all services with a single command:

```bash
docker compose up
```


### 5. Access the Applications

Once all services are running (look for "ready" messages in logs):

* **Web App:** [http://localhost:3745](http://localhost:3745)

If you're using Safari, use [http://127.0.0.1:3745](http://127.0.0.1:3745)

### 6. Add Your First Videos

1. Navigate to the web app at `http://localhost:3745`
2. Login using `admin@example.com` and the password is `admin`
3. Navigate to the web app at `http://localhost:3745/app/settings`
4. Click **"Add Folder"**
3. Select a folder from your `HOST_MEDIA_PATH` location
4. Navigate to the folder details page and click on `Rescan`
4. The background job service will automatically start processing your videos and will start watching for new video file events
