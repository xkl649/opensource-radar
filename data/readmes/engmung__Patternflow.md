> **Photosensitivity warning.** Patternflow displays rapidly changing light patterns that may trigger seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy. If you experience any discomfort, stop use immediately.

**Patternflow is an open-source LED synthesizer.** You play it with four knobs. 8,192 pixels across a 128 × 64 matrix respond the instant you turn one; nothing is pre-rendered, every frame is computed live on the device. A pattern is just a small file, so every Patternflow plays every pattern anyone makes.

## Where it began

Almost every screen around us is a playback device. It takes in content and shows it to us, and we sit in front of it and watch. Patternflow is different: touch it and it answers in that instant, and nobody plays the same thing twice.

In January 2026 I stopped by the Nam June Paik Art Center, which happened to be running an event marking twenty years since Paik's death. That is how I ended up standing in front of *Participation TV* (1963): you speak into a microphone and the picture on the screen moves with your voice. It turned the viewer from someone watching into someone taking part. I spoke into it, and my voice became the picture.

Two months later I connected an LED matrix and a potentiometer for the first time.

Where Paik brought the audience into the work, Patternflow hands over the making of it.

I put that first pattern, *Patternflow: Origin*, on an LED matrix with four knobs and posted it online. Some people asked how to buy it; far more asked how to build it. So everything went public: schematics, firmware, 3D models, the build guide, and the whole workflow for making new patterns.

## The community responded

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/media/community-builds.jpg" width="100%" alt="Seven Patternflows built around the world: different enclosures, colors and materials, two of them in DJ booths" />
</p>
<p align="center">
  <sub><i>Builds by Nath (UK), shooter (Poland), day (France), Enerjoy (Norway), SimonePDA (UAE), Nick (USA), and Jon (USA).</i></sub>
</p>

Builders from around the world keep adding pins to the **[build map](https://patternflow.work/inside)**. Someone built theirs as a Raspberry Pi port with a 64 × 32 matrix, another layered paper and acrylic into a diffuser, others cut their own enclosures. Two of them live in DJ booths.

I started this alone. It hasn't worked that way for a while now. The web-upload feature wasn't mine: someone suggested it, built a proof of concept, and shared the code, and two days later it shipped as a main feature. The `.pfm` pattern modules came the same way. A contributor designed the loader, built it, and proved it on hardware before proposing it. They're core to the instrument now.

The clearest case started on the other side of the world. A media art collective took Patternflow's pattern modules, added MIDI control and a microphone, and built a browser-based instrument of their own: **[MOTIFLOW](https://azmano.art/portfolio-item/motiflow/)**, recently shown in a gallery. Patternflow had become something people build their own instruments out of.

**Patternflow is a thing we're all making now.**

## Make it yours

### 1. The device

The **[Full Build Guide](BUILD_GUIDE.md)** covers the official route: the custom PCB and a 3D-printed enclosure. Don't want to order a board? The **[Breadboard Build Guide](https://patternflow.work/build/breadboard)** wires the same electronics with jumper wires instead, and that's a real Patternflow, not a temporary prototype. Every other combination is on the **[Assembly Map](docs/assembly/README.md)**. Parts run about US$100–200 ([BOM](BUILD_GUIDE.md#1-bill-of-materials-bom)), it's all big through-hole joints, and every first-timer who has built one finished it. Most came back saying the soldering was the fun part.

**When yours lights up, tell us.** Post it in [Discord](https://discord.gg/Vr9QtsxeTk) or [Discussions](../../discussions) and it goes on the build map, a globe of Patternflows where each pin carries its build's story. The map is for the ones people made themselves: every pin is someone who built one from these files, in their own material, wherever they are. The goal is simple: cover it with pins.

</p>

If you'd rather have one arrive assembled, tested, and flashed, the **[Crowd Supply campaign](https://www.crowdsupply.com/engmung/patternflow)** launches **Q4 2026**. Subscribe on the page and you'll hear the moment it opens.

### 2. Patterns

You don't need hardware to start. The **[Live Editor](https://patternflow.work/pattern)** is a full Patternflow simulator: turn the virtual knobs and it behaves like the real thing. Patterns start as JavaScript in the browser, and you don't have to write it yourself. Click **Copy creation prompt**, paste it into your AI assistant with a description of the look you want, paste back the code it returns, and play. You don't write GLSL or touch a rendering pipeline: the template handles the encoder mapping, brightness curve and pixel buffer, and you describe the visuals.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/media/web-live-editor.png" width="100%" alt="Live Editor: a full Patternflow simulator in the browser, code beside the device" />
</p>

**[Pattern Lab](https://patternflow.work/pattern-lab)** is the full studio, and where a pattern reaches the hardware. Generate variations in batches, shape color ramps, retune knob ranges, then send it to your device: it builds into a small `.pfm` module and installs over Wi-Fi, about ten seconds start to finish. You never plug in a cable, reflash the board, or open an IDE.

When it looks right, publish it to the **[Community](https://community.patternflow.work/community)**. More than a hundred patterns are up already and the range keeps widening, from quiet waves to chaos-theory studies, every one written as code and every one playable under the same four knobs. Collect patterns into a deck and send it to your board in one click. Browsing needs no account, and publishing asks a username and password, no email. The **[Pattern Guide](PATTERN_GUIDE.md)** walks the whole loop.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/media/community-library.png" width="100%" alt="The community wall: dozens of patterns by different authors, each one playing, with a deck being assembled along the bottom" />
</p>

Patterns don't stay on the wall, either. New pattern studies go up on **[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/patternflow.work)** almost daily. Publish something that stands out and it can get featured there, or ask for a collab on Instagram and we'll post yours together.

### 3. The ecosystem

Patterns are the surface. Underneath is an instrument still being designed, in the open, by whoever shows up. This is the whole system on one napkin:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/media/at-a-glance.png" width="100%" alt="Hand-drawn map of the Patternflow ecosystem: the device, the GitHub files and Crowd Supply routes to it; patternflow.work with the Live Editor, Pattern Lab and Community wall; Discord, Instagram and GitHub Discussions; and the Workshop, where project talk is gathering" />
</p>

The **[Workshop](https://community.patternflow.work/community/workshop)** is where the project's future is worked out. It's a map of directions Patternflow could take: a wired OSC version, laser-cut enclosures, bigger panels. Anyone can pin themselves to a direction, say what they're working on, and start a thread.

It's already moving in directions I didn't choose. One contributor is building out MQTT further than I've had time to follow: units reaching each other across a network, one person's playing coming out of somebody else's device. Another is working on sound on the board itself. Another is taking the TouchDesigner link further than I did. None of it was assigned.

**[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** covers how contributions flow. Questions and ideas go to **[Discussions](../../discussions)** or the **[Discord](https://discord.gg/Vr9QtsxeTk)**, whichever you can reach.

### Power & runtime

Patternflow runs off any standard USB power bank that can supply a couple of amps at 5 V. You don't need a wall adapter, so it stays portable. Rule of thumb: **about 4 hours per 10,000 mAh** at maximum brightness with a typical pattern.

<details>
<summary>Measured runtimes</summary>

In testing, a 40,000 mAh bank dropped about 13% over 2 hours at **full brightness**, which is roughly **15 hours on a full charge**:

| Power bank | Approx. runtime (max brightness) |
| :--- | :--- |
| 10,000 mAh | ~4 hours |
| 20,000 mAh | ~8 hours |
| 40,000 mAh | ~15 hours |

These were measured with a bright generative pattern at maximum brightness, which is how the device is normally used. Lowering the brightness (long-press encoder 1) extends runtime well beyond these figures.

**Sleep mode** takes it further: the panel goes dark, the HUB75 transfer stops and the board idles, while staying on Wi-Fi so it can be woken again from MQTT or a browser. Hold encoder 2 for the NETWORK screen, then turn encoder 1; any knob or button wakes it. The pattern that was running comes back — as it does after a full power cut.

**A pattern that fills the screen with white is a different story.** The same 40,000 mAh bank dropped 9% in 30 minutes: about 26.6 W, or roughly 4.8 A at 5 V, which is above what a typical USB-A port is rated for and enough to make the connector warm. That works out to ~5.5 hours on a 40,000 mAh bank. A total-pixel-power clamp is going into the firmware so this can't happen; until then, avoid near-full-white patterns on a power bank, or use a supply and cable rated for the current.

</details>

## On the device

A new board boots into **Origin**, concentric sine waves sampled by an emergent grid, and long-pressing encoder 4 cycles through whatever else is installed. Patterns live on the filesystem rather than inside the program. The firmware compiles in Origin alone, as the failsafe a board can always boot into, and everything else installs as **`.pfm` modules over Wi-Fi**, up to 128 of them, no reflash. Adding a pattern never costs a firmware update, and a firmware update never touches your patterns, your Wi-Fi, or your storage.

A new board is therefore nearly empty, so a set ships with it: the **Basics pack**, 33 patterns, at the top of the [decks shelf](https://community.patternflow.work/community/decks). One click installs the lot, no account and no build queue, or drop the `.zip` on your board's Patterns page yourself. The [Live Editor](https://patternflow.work/pattern) opens with its own preset library of 42 patterns, each loadable and remixable in the browser.

The Arduino IDE is only needed for firmware feature development or targeting an LED matrix with a different resolution; see [`firmware/patternflow/README.md`](firmware/patternflow/README.md) and [Custom Patterns](firmware/CUSTOM_PATTERNS.md). To rebuild the shipped pack from the repo's own preset sources, see [`firmware/toolchain/make_pack.py`](firmware/toolchain/make_pack.py).

## OSC, MQTT & audio-react

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/media/daw-ableton.jpg" width="100%" alt="Patternflow beside an Ableton Live session, with the Patternflow Bridge Max for Live device open and the four knobs mapped to Live parameters" />
</p>

**Bidirectional OSC.** Over Wi-Fi, Patternflow speaks OSC in both directions: knob turns, button presses, and pattern switches stream out to a remote host (Ableton Live, Max/MSP, TouchDesigner, anything that speaks OSC), and incoming OSC messages drive the device exactly like physical encoder motion. Play Patternflow as a controller for your set, let your set drive the light, or both at once. If you play MIDI instruments, this will feel like home. For Ableton Live Suite there's a ready-made Max for Live bridge in [`integrations/ableton`](integrations/ableton). Click Connect, map the four knobs to any Live parameters, done. The wire protocol is documented in [`docs/osc-spec.md`](docs/osc-spec.md).

**MQTT.** Patternflow also speaks MQTT, both ways, on the broker you already run. Knob turns and pattern changes publish as they happen; messages coming the other way move the knobs and switch patterns exactly as a hand on the encoder would. Two boards pointed at the same broker follow each other, which is the short version of why it exists. It also puts the device on the same bus as the rest of a home or venue setup, so Home Assistant, Node-RED or a lighting desk can drive it without anything Patternflow-specific in the middle. Point it at a broker on the device's own **MQTT** page; a pattern can be addressed by name or by slug. Publishing `1` to `<prefix>/sleep` puts the panel to sleep and `0` wakes it, with the current state mirrored on `<prefix>/sleep/state` — enough for a Home Assistant switch, and the one command a panel obeys whether it is set to Publisher or Subscriber. Contributed by **[@SimonePDA](https://github.com/SimonePDA)** (Simone Majocchi), along with the browser-side zip unpacking that makes pattern packs install in one click.

**Audio-react.** Patternflow can also react to browser audio. The experimental Chrome/Edge extension in [`tools/patternflow-audio-extension`](tools/patternflow-audio-extension) captures the current tab's audio, analyzes four FFT bands, and sends lightweight WebSocket knob values to the device. The firmware converts those into virtual encoder motion, so every encoder-driven pattern responds, with no audio code needed in the patterns themselves.

## How it's built

Patternflow is built around a standalone ESP32-S3 driving a HUB75 RGB LED matrix at low resolution, where each pixel reads as a discrete point of light with its own brightness and color. Four rotary encoders feed firmware written in Arduino-compatible C++ around a modular pattern architecture: each pattern is a self-contained module with its own setup, update, and draw routines, while the shared framework handles input, LED rendering, mode transitions, and color calibration. I designed the PCB myself; the enclosure is 3D-printed by default, with stainless steel, transparent acrylic, and laser-cut variations in progress.

## Repository & documentation

> **Moving fast.** [v3.3.0 is out](https://github.com/engmung/Patternflow/releases/tag/v3.3.0): the panel's color is tunable while you look at it, and ramps interpolate in OKLab instead of collapsing to grey. [v3.2.0](https://github.com/engmung/Patternflow/releases/tag/v3.2.0) made patterns install over Wi-Fi as `.pfm` modules, no reflash. On v2.x hardware? Everything you need stays bundled at [v2.1.0](https://github.com/engmung/Patternflow/releases/tag/v2.1.0).
