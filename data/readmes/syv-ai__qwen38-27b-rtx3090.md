# Qwen3.8-27B on one RTX 3090

![Stock vLLM against this repo, same card, same prompts](docs/media/demo.gif)

Serving setup for [Qwen3.8-27B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B) on a
single 24 GB consumer GPU with vLLM. 150k token context, OpenAI-compatible
API with key auth, and two ready-made configs depending on what you're doing:

| | [batch/](batch/) | [single-user/](single-user/) |
|---|---|---|
| for | API backends, pipelines, many concurrent requests | one or a few people chatting |
| aggregate, 64 concurrent (128 in / 512 out) | **~1,035 tok/s** steady-state decode, 948 end-to-end (~1,222 / 1,042 with all layers int8) | n/a (8 slots) |
| single-stream (C1) decode rate, realistic prompts | 46 tok/s | MTP: **111** tok/s at default sampling, **120** greedy (`CTX=fast`, 64k; 85 / 89 with `CTX=long`, 150k). DFlash2 (`SPEC=dflash2`): **122** default, **131** greedy |
| reproducing its own context (quoting a document, applying an edit) | 46 tok/s | **381 tok/s** at 25k context — 15.0 tokens per verify step, drafted straight from the prompt (`SPEC=dflash2` + `DFLASH_TOKENS=15`) |
| trick | 16-bit recurrent state + int8 tensor-core GEMMs | MTP speculation with 4 cheap drafts, a draft vocabulary that covers what the model says, calibrated int4 lm_head/drafter, split-KV verify attention; optionally DFlash2 (7 drafts in one pass, int4-requantized, vLLM PR #52816 backported) with a verify block the context fills |

Both modes share one install — the mode is just which launch script you run.
Speculation wins below ~8 concurrent users, plain batching above. Numbers are
`vllm bench serve` on an RTX 3090 at a 250 W power limit. If the card is yours
alone, the fastest configuration is three environment variables away:
[If you are the only user](#if-you-are-the-only-user-do-this).

Prefill is a separate budget from either: ~1,810 tok/s at 1k inputs in batch
mode (~1,210 single-user), ~1,000 tok/s at 100k, so a 100k prompt costs ~100 s
of TTFT ([full matrix](batch/README.md#prefill)). How each number was won:
[docs/optimizations.md](docs/optimizations.md).

## Quick start

Docker (recommended — image build, model download and requantization, then
the server; the API is OpenAI-compatible on port 18020):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/syv-ai/qwen38-27b-rtx3090 && cd qwen38-27b-rtx3090
docker compose --profile single up -d      # one or a few users; or --profile batch
```

The server listens on `0.0.0.0` and is unauthenticated unless you give it a key.
For anything past your own machine, add one first — everything reads it from
`.env` or `api_key.txt`, and nothing needs it otherwise:

```bash
echo "VLLM_API_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 24)" > .env
```

Or by hand in a venv (same steps: model download, requantization, vLLM
patches, `verify.sh`) — see [Setup](#setup). Then pick a mode:
[batch/](batch/) for throughput, [single-user/](single-user/) for latency.

### If you are the only user, do this

The command above starts the conservative default — MTP speculation, 8 request
slots, 64k context, 120 tok/s greedy at C1. Three settings are worth more than
every other knob in this repo put together:

```bash
printf 'SPEC=dflash2\nDFLASH_TOKENS=15\nPREFIX_CACHE=1\n' >> .env
docker compose --profile single up -d
```

or, in the venv install:

```bash
venv/bin/python prepare/fetch_dflash2.py   # once, 1.2 GB (Docker's prepare step does it for you)
SPEC=dflash2 DFLASH_TOKENS=15 PREFIX_CACHE=1 bash single-user/start_qwen.sh
```

`SPEC=dflash2` swaps Qwen's MTP head for the DFlash2 block drafter: 7 tokens
proposed in one pass instead of 4 chained ones. `DFLASH_TOKENS=15` then lets the
target verify 16 tokens per step — the drafter still proposes the 7 it was
trained for, and the remaining positions are filled from the request's own
context, which costs nothing to draft and is exactly right whenever the answer
quotes the prompt. `PREFIX_CACHE=1` keeps the document you already sent, both
its attention KV and its recurrent state. One request at a time, greedy, RTX
3090 at 250 W:

| decode | MTP (default) | `SPEC=dflash2` | `+ DFLASH_TOKENS=15` |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8 real chat prompts | 118 tok/s | 132 | **133** |
| reproducing a 25k-token document | n/a* | 260 | **382** |
| request slots / context | 8 / 64k | 8 / 64k | 4 / 56k |

<sub>\* drafting from the context only exists in `SPEC=dflash2`. The two right
columns are one server session, where run-to-run greedy divergence is ±3-5%;
reproduce them with `venv/bin/python bench/labd_bench.py <tag> --ctx 20000`.</sub>

`PREFIX_CACHE=1` is orthogonal to the other two and worth as much again in a
chat client: a second turn against that same 25k-token document takes 0.56 s to
first token instead of 22.4 s, with the answers unchanged token for token.

All of it is lossless: speculative decoding samples the same distribution as no
speculation at all, the prefix cache resumes recurrent state rather than
approximating it, and GSM8K reads 96.0-96.5% across the three columns. What
`DFLASH_TOKENS=15` costs is half the request slots and 8k of context — that is
the whole reason it is opt-in, and why the default stays where it is for anyone
serving more than a few people. Every other knob: [single-user/](single-user/).

### DFlash2 at 240k: `CTX=huge` (KVarN) also combines with `SPEC=dflash2`

```bash
bash kvarn/install.sh                # applies kvarn-v2-runner.patch as its second stage
SPEC=dflash2 CTX=huge PREFIX_CACHE=1 bash single-user/start_qwen.sh
```

Where `CTX=long` doubles the DFlash2 pool with int8 KV (138k), the KVarN cache
takes the same idea further: 268k tokens of pool at 245760 max-model-len, on the
same pinned budget. No kernel work — the KVarN Triton kernels run unmodified on
the V2 runner; the seven fixes in `kvarn/kvarn-v2-runner.patch` are allocator and
geometry logic (the patch header walks through them, including an upstream vLLM
bug in the mamba align resume path, and a NaN path in the DFlash2 candidate
selector that KVarN noise exposes on verbatim-reproduction content). Two
machines, both RTX 3090 at 250 W, `bench/labd_bench.py --ctx 20000` — the
contributor's WSL2 box and this repo's bare-metal one, which do not agree on
decode rate and do agree on everything else:

| `SPEC=dflash2 CTX=huge PREFIX_CACHE=1` | WSL2 | bare metal |
|---|---|---|
| copy (reproduction) | 130 tok/s, 7.8 tok/step | 164 tok/s, 7.83 tok/step |
| code / edit / quote / summary / qa | 89 / 65 / 44 / 38 / 36 | 109 / 83 / 58 / 51 / 43 |
| all six tasks together | 53 tok/s, 3.0 tok/step | 67 tok/s, 3.15 tok/step |
| verbatim reproduction, 25k document | correct | 1,150 / 1,150 chars |
| KV capacity at 245760 max-model-len | 268,169 tokens | 268,169 tokens |
| GSM8K exact-match (thinking off) | 97.0% (n=200) | 95.2% (n=600), 95.0% (n=200) |
| 100k-deep needle, both turns | correct | — |
| turn 2 over a 100k cached prefix | 4.7 s (vs 169 s cold) | — |

<sub>Context for the GSM8K column: every configuration this repo already ships
reads 95.0-96.5% on the same 200-question harness ([docs/quality.md](docs/quality.md)),
and 95.0% is the batch-mode default. 95.2% at n=600 (±0.9 points) therefore sits
inside the band rather than below it — which is the useful comparison, since this
mode inherits KVarN's lossy 4/2-bit cache and should be judged against the other
lossy configurations rather than against bf16. Repeat runs of the reproduction
check on bare metal are bit-identical (same step count, same 1,150 characters),
which is the property that was missing before `PIECEWISE` — see below.</sub>

One caveat to the "all of it is lossless" paragraph above: the speculation here
is still exact, but this mode inherits KVarN's 4/2-bit KV cache, which is lossy —
the same trade `CTX=huge` already makes (deep-needle retrieval passes at 200k).
On WSL2, set `VLLM_WSL2_ENABLE_PIN_MEMORY=1` — the V2 runner needs pinned
memory, and vLLM leaves it off by default there; its UVA buffers work fine on
the paravirt driver.

One knob this mode sets for you: `cudagraph_mode=PIECEWISE`. Prefix caching and
a *captured* (FULL) verify step do not currently mix on this path. On WSL2 that
showed up as acceptance collapsing to about one token per step; on bare metal it
also **corrupted the output** — special-token ids leaking into the stream, a
different failure on every run, 1 of 1,176 characters matching the source
instead of all of them. It is the capture rather than the drafter: eager is
clean, `LOOKUP=0` is not, forcing a fixed verify-block length is not, and
PIECEWISE — which keeps the compiled graphs and leaves only the multi-query
verify uncaptured — restores both the speed and the correctness on both
machines. So `CTX=huge` runs PIECEWISE and keeps prefix caching, which is worth
having: turn 2 over a cached 100k document costs 4.7 s against 169 s cold.

`CUDAGRAPH_MODE=FULL_AND_PIECEWISE` switches the capture back for anyone hunting
the root cause. Treat that as unsafe rather than merely slower — the corruption
above is what it does on bare metal.

Two limits worth knowing before you point this at anything, both from an
independent RTX 3090 Ti reproduction ([#13](https://github.com/syv-ai/qwen38-27b-rtx3090/pull/13)):
**it is a single-user mode, not a shared one.** At 8 concurrent streams the block
verify batches badly — 16-73 tok/s per stream, ~131 aggregate, against ~447 for
`SPEC=mtp` on bf16 KV on the same card. One person with a large document is what
this is for; a crowd is what `batch/` is for. And `DFLASH_TOKENS=15` does not
boot at this context on 24 GB — the pinned-buffer arithmetic in
[docs/long-context.md](docs/long-context.md) says why — so reproduction mode and
240k are mutually exclusive here; the default 7 is what this mode runs.

It is a trade rather than a free win: dropping the full decode graphs costs
short-prompt throughput. Same box, same script, only the capture toggled,
three runs each:

| | `copy` @25k | de | en | code |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `FULL_AND_PIECEWISE` | 38 tok/s (1.97/step) | 78 | 125 | 202 |
| PIECEWISE (default here) | **132 tok/s (7.83/step)** | 74 | 102 | 176 |

3.5x on the long shared prefix this mode exists for, 13-18% off short-prompt
decode. The capture mode is fixed at boot, so `CTX=huge` takes the trade that
matches what it is for. `CUDAGRAPH_MODE=FULL_AND_PIECEWISE` switches back, but
treat that as unsafe until the capture bug is understood — here it only cost
speed, on a bare-metal tree it corrupted the output. The hunt is in the PR
thread.

## Benchmarks

Full tables per mode in [batch/README.md](batch/README.md) and
[single-user/README.md](single-user/README.md); quality in
[docs/quality.md](docs/quality.md). Reproduce any of it with
`bash bench/run_benchmarks.sh batch|single` against your own server.

### vs. ninfer-3090

[ninfer-3090](https://github.com/Don-Chad/ninfer-3090) is a standalone C++/CUDA engine
that publishes cohort benchmarks for this model on this card. Theirs are 1,024-token
answers from 29-34-token prompts, greedy, MTP3, int8 KV, prefix reuse off, an
8,192-token context window, and **thinking on** at `reasoning_effort=medium`, so their
1,024 tokens include reasoning. Ours are 8 realistic chat prompts (English, Danish,
code), 1,024-token answers, model-default sampling, thinking off:

| Cohort | ninfer-3090 (MTP3) | this repo, batch | single-user, MTP | single-user, DFlash2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | 71.00 tok/s | 45.5 | 111.1 | **121.8** |
| C2 | 90.66 tok/s | 86.3 | 191.8 | **195.5** |
| C4 | 100.28 tok/s | 168.3 | 268.5 | **278.9** |
| C8 | 165.33 tok/s | 324.9 | **407.3** | 389.9 |
| C64 (128 in / 512 out) | not supported | **~1,035** | — | — |

Decode rate, C × 1000 / mean TPOT. All four of our columns were re-measured together
on the current stack with `bench/run_benchmarks.sh`, keeping the second run after each
restart as the script advises; greedy instead of default sampling reads
131.2 / 214.6 / 285.7 / 405.5 for DFlash2. Run-to-run spread on the same server is
5-8%, so treat one-decimal differences between the three right-hand columns as noise —
C1 and C8 are where the modes genuinely separate.

Theirs is the **decode** column of their table; their end-to-end column reads
70.19 / 89.43 / 97.89 / 161.28, and an earlier version of this table quoted *those*
against our decode rate, which was not like-for-like. What still is not like-for-like,
in their favour and ours: their C1 is a single prompt in a single run with no error
bars, thinking is on for them and off for us, and they publish no power limit or driver
version — ours is an RTX 3090 pinned at 250 W. Peak VRAM is comparable (23.0 vs
22.1 GiB at C8). The gap is mostly vLLM's continuous batching plus the memory this
repo's requantization frees up.

### Quality

The whole stack is quantized, so the honest question is what it costs. Short
version: **IFBench 78.3** prompt-level strict vs 79.5 for the unquantized model
(one point), **perplexity 8.09** on 33k held-out tokens, **GSM8K 96.5%** (200
questions, greedy). Speculative decoding — MTP, DFlash2 and the lookup drafter —
is exact by construction and changes none of it; the int8-activation steps in
batch mode are the only knobs that trade accuracy for speed, and they cost
0.9-3.7% perplexity depending on how far you push them. Per-configuration
tables: [docs/quality.md](docs/quality.md).

### Why this isn't just `vllm serve`

Nine things, from requantizing both embedding matrices to drafting straight out
of the prompt — one line each, then the reasoning and measurements, in
[docs/optimizations.md](docs/optimizations.md).

### What each step buys

Measured cumulatively on the 3090, 64 concurrent, 128 in / 512 out, `vllm bench
serve` random dataset:

| step | what it does | e2e output tok/s | steady-state decode |
|---|---|---|---|
| W4A16 AutoRound body (as published) + fp8 KV | int4 Marlin kernels, 66.7k-token pool | 370 (48 conc, 256/256) | — |
| + lm_head / embed_tokens int8 | 2.6 GB of cache pages back | 516 | ~585 (37 requests resident) |
| + fp16 recurrent state | 64 requests resident, half the state traffic | 707 | ~830 |
| + int8 activations, MLP (default) | int8 tensor cores on 74% of the FLOPs | 942 | ~1,094 |
| + int8 activations, everything (`INT8_LAYERS=.`, needs `GPU_UTIL=0.95`) | | 1,042 | ~1,222 |

And single-stream on realistic prompts (single-user mode, T = model default /
greedy):

| step | tok/s | tokens per step | draft acceptance, position 0 |
|---|---|---|---|
| no speculation | 46 / 46 | 1.0 | — |
| MTP-2 as shipped (bf16 drafter, full head, fp32 state) | 66 / 79 | 2.1 / 2.4 | 65% / 80% |
| MTP-4, int8 drafter, 40k draft head, fp16 state | 78 / 99 | 2.2 / 2.7 | 58% / 70% |
| + probabilistic draft sampling (`CTX=fast`, k=4) | 90 / 98 | 2.6 / 2.7 | 69% / 70% |
| same with 3 drafts on FlashInfer/fp8 KV (`CTX=long`, 150k) | 84 / 89 | 2.5 / 2.4 | 69% / 71% |
| + sampler patch, split-KV verify attention | 93 / 99 | 2.6 / 2.6 | 69% / 70% |
| + draft vocab counted over the model's own outputs | 107 / 109 | 2.9 / 2.9 | 74% / 74% |
| + GPTQ-int4 lm_head (calibrated) | 109 / 112 | 2.8 / 2.8 | 73% / 73% |
| + GPTQ-int4 MTP module (**fast variant, shipped**) | **~114 / 118-124** | 2.8 / 2.9-3.0 | 74% / 77% |
| DFlash2 block drafter instead of MTP (`SPEC=dflash2`, int4-requantized) | **118 / 126** | 3.14 / 3.34 | ~75% / ~78% |
| + drafting from the context (`LOOKUP=1`, on by default) | **130** at C1, up to **259** where the model reproduces its context | 3.3-7.8 | |
| + a 16-token verify block the context fills (`DFLASH_TOKENS=15`) | **133** at C1, up to **381** reproducing context | 3.4-15.0 | |

(Steps 4-6 are the same 8-prompt protocol; greedy is deterministic for a
given server and request order but differs between configs and even with
prefix-cache hits, so single runs carry ±3-5% on tokens/step —
`bench/run_benchmarks.sh single` reproduces 111.1 / 120.0 tok/s decode at C1,
the best repeats read 119 / 124.)
Going deeper (k=5) loses again: 106 / 105. k=4 is the knee, but on vLLM
0.27.1's FlashInfer backend (needed for fp8 KV, i.e. for 150k context) four
drafts crash the engine with an illegal memory access as soon as one request
finishes while another is mid-generation — club-3090 reports the same "n=4
eventually dies, n=3 stable" pattern — so `CTX=long` drafts 3 and gives up
~7%; `CTX=fast` (FlashAttention, bf16 KV, ~64k context, the default) keeps k=4
and is also the only backend the split-KV attention patch applies to.

Two things that did *not* help, measured rather than assumed: fine-tuning the
MTP head on the model's own outputs (KL halves, greedy top-1 on response
tokens unchanged; `drafter/README.md`), and retuning Marlin's tile
configuration for M ≤ 16 on sm86 (3-7% per GEMM in isolation,
nothing measurable end to end — the remaining gap to peak bandwidth is the
memory system's ramp on 16-92 MB reads, not the kernel).

## Setup

You need: a 24 GB Ampere or newer NVIDIA card, a recent driver, Python 3.12,
~40 GB disk. Everything below is CPU-safe to run while the GPU does other
things. (Or skip the venv and use the container: [docs/docker.md](docs/docker.md).)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/syv-ai/qwen38-27b-rtx3090 ~/qwen-serving
cd ~/qwen-serving

python3 -m venv venv
venv/bin/pip install vllm huggingface_hub hf_transfer ninja

# model, ~19.5 GB
HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1 venv/bin/hf download \
  dbirks/Qwen3.8-27B-W4A16-AutoRound \
  --local-dir models/Qwen3.8-27B-W4A16-AutoRound

# requantize lm_head + embeddings + the MTP draft module (CPU only, a few minutes)
venv/bin/python prepare/quant_lm_head.py models/Qwen3.8-27B-W4A16-AutoRound
venv/bin/python prepare/quant_embed.py   models/Qwen3.8-27B-W4A16-AutoRound
venv/bin/python prepare/quant_mtp.py     models/Qwen3.8-27B-W4A16-AutoRound
# 40k-token draft head for single-user mode (uses the shipped id list)
venv/bin/python prepare/build_draft_vocab.py models/Qwen3.8-27B-W4A16-AutoRound \
  --ids prepare/draft_vocab_ids.json
# single-user "fast" variant (~1 GB from the Hub, hardlinks the rest): int4-GPTQ
# lm_head + drafter; single-user/start_qwen.sh picks it up automatically
venv/bin/python prepare/fetch_fast_variant.py
# optional: the W4A16 DFlash2 block drafter (1.2 GB) for SPEC=dflash2 single-user mode
venv/bin/python prepare/fetch_dflash2.py

# patch vllm (all written against 0.27.1; reapply after upgrades)
for p in patches/*.patch; do
  patch -p1 -d venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/vllm < $p
done
# optional: the KVarN 4/2-bit KV cache for 262k context (docs/long-context.md)
bash kvarn/install.sh

# api key — optional, but the server binds 0.0.0.0 and is open without one
openssl rand -hex 24 > api_key.txt
```

Then `bash verify.sh --no-server` — it checks the venv and vLLM version, that
every patch in `patches/` is actually applied, and that the model has been
requantized (lm_head, embeddings, MTP module, draft head). Then pick a mode
and follow its README:

- **[batch/](batch/)** — throughput. `bash batch/start_qwen.sh`
- **[single-user/](single-user/)** — latency. `bash single-user/start_qwen.sh`

First start takes a few minutes (torch.compile, CUDA graph capture, flashinfer
JIT). Test it:

```bash
curl http://localhost:18020/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat api_key.txt 2>/dev/null)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "qwen3.8-27b",
       "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hej"}],
       "chat_template_kwargs": {"enable_thinking": false}}'
```

Qwen recommends temperature 0.7 / top_p 0.8 for instruct mode, and 1.0 / 0.95
with thinking enabled (the default).

To check the numbers on your own card: `bash verify.sh` (also probes the live
server and prints which attention backend and KV pool it came up with), then
`bash bench/run_benchmarks.sh batch` or `... single` reproduces the tables
above against the running server (`--prefill` and `--long` add the prefill
matrix and the long-context rows), `bash bench/real_rep.sh <tag> 3 0` repeats
the single-stream row, and `python bench/quality_battery.py <tag>` the
perplexity / GSM8K rows.
